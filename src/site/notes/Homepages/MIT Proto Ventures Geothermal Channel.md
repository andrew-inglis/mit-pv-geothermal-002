# MIT Proto Ventures Geothermal Channel

## Listing of identified opportunities into the Proto Ventures taxonomy

### Description of site
This database visualization is a selection of the database entries for public dissemination related to the MIT Proto Ventures Geothermal Channel activity. Here you will find the identified opportunities that are being explored as of the end of the Phase I of the GEODE x Proto Ventures project.

### How to use this site
On the left hand side is a directory structure of the "nodes" in the taxonomy.
Each node can be selected to read about the concept. 
There are several types of nodes that will be described here:

- **Capabilities** - technologies, inventions, ideas, that have been logged from the MIT  community that may be able to be leveraged to solve challenges and needs within geothermal.
- **Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal** - list of current challenges within the geothermal space
- **Companies** - Companies in the geothermal ecosystem
- **General Technology and Approaches** - Technology that may have already been developed, or needs to be advanced, that is relevant the geothermal ecosystem
- **Organizations** - groups, including investors, that are relevant to the geothermal ecosystem
- **People** - the people that I have engaged with at MIT and geothermal ecosystem

For any given "node", there will be "links" to other "nodes" that are relevant to that topic.

### "Nodes" not included within this public portal

Due to the privacy and/or confidential information of some types of nodes, they have not been included in this public portal, but have been reported on as needed within the Status Update Report to Project Innerspace / GEODE / DOE 
Some of these "nodes" may be "linked" to "nodes" that are available on this portal, so their titles may be visible, but the "node" itself will give an error message when the link is clicked on.
The following is a general list of "nodes" that are not included in this portal:
- MIT Student names
- Venture ideas and explorations
- Meeting notes.

Thank you, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.
