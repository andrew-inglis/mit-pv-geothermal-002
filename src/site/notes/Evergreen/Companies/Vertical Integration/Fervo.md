## About
(from [[Evergreen/People/Jack Norbeck\|Jack Norbeck]] talk at [[Inputs/Events/2025-02-10,12 Stanford Geothermal Workshop\|2025-02-10,12 Stanford Geothermal Workshop]])
- Fundraising (2025-02)
	- 555M equity (Fervo Family)
	- 45M non-dilutive
	- 220M in debt financing
- Project Red
	- 1 year in, constant temp
### Project Cape
- Next to the FORGE site. (image is cool)
- Getting into the technical, what everyone wants!
- Learning rate
	- global 33% cape
	- learning curve 16%
- Seeing high stress
- pressure response
	- increase 100s ft away after pressure in the injector
- Can mitigate flow rate by drilling another hole, but not temperature.
- Collect datasets to prove the temp decline?
	- Surface area, plot it.
		- linear flow
		- surface area estimate, 95 million sq ft.
		- Gringarten type curves.
- Estimating
	- 85MW per 1 mile
	- real data underpinning
	- was previously underestimating by order of magnitude.
	- Scaling
		- 10 MW per 4800 ft producer
		- 1:1 injector: producer
		- 100 MW per rig per year
		- 1 GW for 10 rigs
