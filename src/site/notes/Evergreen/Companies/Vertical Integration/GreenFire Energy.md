## About
https://www.greenfireenergy.com/greenloop-technology/

GreenLoop’s approach to the development of geothermal energy comprises a broad technology set that can be configured to provide optimum output from any combination of geothermal resources and existing assets. GreenLoop designs are the physical attributes of the system including the architecture of the pipe system, the size and specification of materials, and the working fluid to be used. A typical GreenLoop design features a co-axial Downbore Heat Exchanger (DBHX) inserted into a single wellbore that circulates a working fluid to absorb and transport heat to the surface. GreenLoop designs are carefully engineered to work with all the major brands of power generators and to deliver precise heat for industrial applications.
