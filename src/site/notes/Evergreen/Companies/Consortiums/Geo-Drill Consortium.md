## About
https://www.geodrill-project.eu/consortium

From website:


 **_The overall objective_** **_for Geo-Drill is to develop “holistic” drilling technologies that have the potential to drastically reduce the cost of drilling to large depths (5km or more) and at high temperatures (250ºC or more)._**

 Geo-Drill aims to reduce drilling cost with increased Rate Of Penetration (ROP) and reduced tripping with improved tools lives. The drilling technology proposed includes (see services):

- a bi-stable fluidic amplifier driven mud hammer,
    
- low cost 3D printed sensors & cables,
    
- drill monitoring system,
    
- Graphene based materials and coatings.
