## About

Thomas is a good friend of Andrew's through [[Evergreen/People/Nathan Woodard\|Nathan Woodard]]. Multiple YC founder. Current Endeavor:
(https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7237474578518679554/)[Rewbi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rewbi/) (YC S24) uses AI to optimize grid-connected battery storage. They generate revenue by charging batteries when electricity is cheap and discharging when electricity is expensive.  
  
Rewbi rents battery storage for a fixed monthly fee, and earns more than double that fee in monthly revenue by dispatching the battery optimally.  
  
Today, power companies use human traders to manually track grid conditions and update the batteryâ€™s dispatch schedule. However, batteries can adjust their power output 100x faster than traditional power generation (e.g., hydro, coal, nuclear, gas), with the ability to go from full-speed charging to full-speed discharging in under a minute. Electricity prices change every 5 minutes, often by 300% or more. Rewbi's AI better tracks 100s of live inputs, and it makes decisions faster than a human operator (with lower overhead), more than doubling revenue.
