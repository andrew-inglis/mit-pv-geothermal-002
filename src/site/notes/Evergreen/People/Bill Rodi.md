## About this person


Bill Rodi at MIT is a research affiliate at the Earth Resources Laboratory whose primary research focus is geophysical inverse theory. His work centers on developing numerical algorithms and uncertainty analysis methods for nonlinear inverse problems, particularly in seismology and electromagnetics[](https://erlweb.mit.edu/users/rodierlmitedu).

His research involves:

- Creating and refining algorithms for solving complex inverse problems, which are mathematical techniques used to infer subsurface properties from geophysical data.
    
- Applying these methods to both seismological and electromagnetic data to improve subsurface imaging and characterization.
    
- Conducting uncertainty analysis to quantify the reliability and resolution of inversion results, which is crucial for interpreting geophysical surveys[](https://erlweb.mit.edu/users/rodierlmitedu).
    

Rodiâ€™s contributions have been instrumental in advancing techniques such as 2-D and 3-D electrical resistivity tomography, magnetotellurics, and seismic data inversion, with applications ranging from environmental site characterization to groundwater contamination mapping and geothermal field monitoring[](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/9878/41671058-MIT.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y).
