## About this person

https://eaps.mit.edu/people/faculty/lyle-nelson/

My research group focuses on regional sedimentary geology to understand relationships in the co-evolution of life and surface environments across pivotal transitions in Earth history, especially during significant biological shifts — such as extinctions and the emergence of new species — and during shifts in ocean chemistry and climate.
