Hi Cindy:

I just started a two year EIR position funded by GEODE to identify technologies that otherwise may be overlooked at MIT (potentially other institutions), then work to get them spun up in the right way to support commercial liftoff of the greater geothermal ecosystem. The mandate is all geo, but a focus is “next-gen”/deep. I have been getting a good amount of tech pain point information from Project Innerspace, but engaging with the make-or-break decision makers at the tops of trailblazing companies will be a game-changer on how I approach supporting the ecosystem.

I was wondering if we can get on a quick call to discuss more?

Here is my landing page:

Thanks much, and looking forward to it.

-Andrew
