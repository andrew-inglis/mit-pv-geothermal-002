Invite to [[Inputs/Events/2025-05-14,15 MITei Future Energy Systems Center (FESC) Spring Workshop\|2025-05-14,15 MITei Future Energy Systems Center (FESC) Spring Workshop]]

In the meantime, it is my pleasure to invite you to participate in MIT’s Future Energy Systems Center Spring workshop. We hope you will join us as a panelist on the topic of “Learning by doing: How Incremental Geothermal Innovation is Unlocking Clean Power” on May 15th. In this panel, we seek to bring together experts with a range of views on this topic to share their perspectives with our members and stimulate some thought-provoking dialogue.

We are particularly focusing on the progress of people, efforts, and companies that are taking the “learning by doing” approach to growing geothermal electricity generation. Here is the description of the panel:   
  
“The geothermal landscape spans a wide range of applications, from shallow-drill heat pump systems to the ambitious concept of 'geothermal anywhere' electricity generation using superhot, superdeep resources. In the middle lies a promising approach focused on methodical 'learning by doing,' leading to significant improvements and cost reductions. This strategy may offer the most practical path to achieving widespread geothermal electricity production. A panel of visionaries is driving progress in this dynamic and evolving field.”
