## About this person
https://www.mit.edu/~demiller/

Retired from a three decade career as a research scientist at Schlumberger's labs in Ridgefield CT, Cambridge UK and Cambridge MA, I am presently a Research Affiliate of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT and Principal Scientist at Miller Applied Science, LLC. I welcome opportunities to collaborate on scientifically interesting data analysis or technology development projects in geophysics, ultrasonics, or remote sensing.
