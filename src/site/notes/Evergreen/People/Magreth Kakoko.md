## _1st year PhD student and PEM scholar  
Rock Mechanics Lab_ 

Magreth Kakoko is a Program for Exemplary Mentoring (PEM) scholar and a PhD student in Professor Herbert Einstein’s Rock Mechanics Lab. She graduated from MIT in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering, followed by a Master’s in Geosystems Engineering from UC Berkeley the following year. After earning her Master’s, she worked as a geotechnical engineer (EIT) before returning to MIT for graduate studies. Her research focuses on the stability of ultra-deep boreholes drilled with millimeter wave (MMW) gyrotrons. She uses various geomechanics models to analyze and predict the stability of MMW-drilled wellbores in high-temperature and pressure conditions. Outside of research, she enjoys watching and analyzing soccer, and  considers herself a budding baker.
