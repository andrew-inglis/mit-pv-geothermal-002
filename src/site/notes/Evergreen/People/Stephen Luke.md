## About this person

currently a senior official with DHS in the Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans. In my current job, I'm responsible for delivering the Department's Quadrennial Homeland Security Review - however, in my past life I was a colleague of Mark's at DHS's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)/Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD) leading R&D programs - specifically related to advanced analytics in the CBRN space. I have also spent several years with DOE as a deployed radiological emergency responder, including deploying to Japan to oversee aerial surveys immediately after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster.


I've attached my resume to this email to give you both some more detail about my background. I really appreciate the offer to chat about the lay of the land at Silverside (and in the DOD contractor space in the northeast in general) and about what opportunities might exist. My schedule is pretty flexible for now, so please feel free to pick a time that works best for you both (together or separately - just let me know what makes sense).
