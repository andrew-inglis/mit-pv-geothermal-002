## About this person
https://erlweb.mit.edu/people/lluis-salo-salgado/

I am a geoscientist working at the intersection of geology, flow in porous media, geomechanics and seismology to address pressing questions related to geoenergy and the environment. I approach these questions primarily through a combination of computational tools (physics-based simulation, statistical modeling, data analysis) with the goal of quantifying answers and their uncertainty.

My work focuses on geologic CO2 storage. Specifically, I am targeting the following two areas:  
(1) Development of new computer models to characterize the hydraulic properties of faults.  
(2) Numerical modeling of CO2 storage, with emphasis on fault zones and their impact on fluid migration.

Before starting my PhD, I worked with seismic signals generated by earthquakes and other processes.‚Äù
