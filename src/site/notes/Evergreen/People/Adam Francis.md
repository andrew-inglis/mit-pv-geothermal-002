## About
Interested in Geothermal Projects:

from [[Evergreen/People/DeAndrea Salvador\|DeAndrea Salvador]]:

Here is a little bit about Adam’s idea: 

- My idea, born during IDEA Week, envisions transforming the Caribbean Basin into a leading renewable energy hub by harnessing the region’s unique geological resources. This includes using proven technologies like equatorial solar power and geothermal energy from volcanic activity, as well as pioneering methods to capture energy from seismic and hurricane forces. The approach will encompass energy capture, storage, and delivery systems. The goal is not only to meet the growing critical demand for sustainable energy solutions but also to provide an economic boost to the Caribbean, addressing severe economic instability in the region.

Additionally, here is his bio:

- Adam Francis currently serves as the Deputy Director of Training, Exercises, and Readiness for Joint Force Headquarters – Department of Defense Information Network (JFHQ-DODIN), United States Cyber Command. He directs the command's development and preparation of a world-class cyber workforce. Formerly he was the Cyber Mission Force Development Chief at United States Cyber Command, where he spearheaded the congressionally mandated delegation of training duties and responsibilities to the Military services. Throughout his 18-year career, Adam has led teams at the Computer Sciences Corporation, the Joint Task Force - Global Network Operations, and currently serves on the board of directors for Shea Yeleen.
