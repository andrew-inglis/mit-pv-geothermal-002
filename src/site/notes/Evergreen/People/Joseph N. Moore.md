## About this person
works at the [[Energy and Geosciences Institute\|Energy and Geosciences Institute]]
Talking at [[Inputs/Events/2025-02-10,12 Stanford Geothermal Workshop\|2025-02-10,12 Stanford Geothermal Workshop]] about FORGE

Gave the first talk
FORGE, goal was to use O&G to get to 175 C(?) 
drill one well, stimulate, look at the field of seismic fractures, then drill again.

- test flow
- test propants
	- ended up with poured sand
- fibers
	- cemented into the annulus of the casing.
- Tracers
	- quantum dots and others.
- Seismic monitoring
	- geophones, 3 types
	- [[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/Geophones that last at higher than 150 deg C\|Geophones that last at higher than 150 deg C]]
	- [[geoenergy swiss\|geoenergy swiss]] did the seismic displays
- Strain rate change.
	- fascinating waterfall maps
- Geochemistry
- test [[bridge plugs\|bridge plugs]]
	- Failed
- 3 hour cycling time for their experiments.
	- Commecial flow rates and temperatures 180C
- pressure decreases
	- Tight system (?) even if it is decreasing?
- Temperature decline / breakthrough in 30 days (?)
- Next steps
	- 
- All data si at the [[Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)\|Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)]]
- then the wiki pages

- [ ] play with the [[Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)\|Geothermal Data Repository (GDR)]]
## How we met
Last day of conf, had a chat about FORGE.


## Selected conversations

Talking about what they need:
- [[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/High temperature sensors\|High temperature sensors]]
	- [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal integration non-drilling/SLB (Schlumberger)\|SLB (Schlumberger)]] and [[Halliburton\|Halliburton]] are not investing in this
- [[high temp packers and plugs\|high temp packers and plugs]]
- [[high temp pumps\|high temp pumps]]
- [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal integration non-drilling/Ormat\|Ormat]] is making everything, and thinking about being vertically integrated (!)

Talked about the major studies are to reduce [[fast-pass\|fast-pass]]
	- potentially with a [[sliding sleeve\|sliding sleeve]]
