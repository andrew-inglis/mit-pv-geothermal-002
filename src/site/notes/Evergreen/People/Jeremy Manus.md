## About this person



from [[Evergreen/People/Kevin DiGenova\|Kevin DiGenova]]

 Jeremy has had successive roles first in compressed air energy storage where we worried about drilling to create stable caverns; then at Shell Techworks addressing some of Shell's most pressing technology challenges; before spinning off his own hydrogen technology and services company with some colleagues that they sold a few years ago.

  
He immediately asked me questions about how well MIT Proto Ventures understands the state of the art in drilling, which is largely oil and gas technology.  Drilling is not Jeremy's specific area of expertise, but he has a sense of it and likely could locate some people who are experts.  I didn't know the answer to his question, but suggested it might be interesting for us all to get lunch together and chat.  Let me know if you have bandwidth and interest!  This week we are trying to close out the semester, but after that things will open up again.
