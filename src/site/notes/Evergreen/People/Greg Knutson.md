## About this person

on linkedin:
Andrew,  
  
Thanks for your presentation and introduction to Proto Ventures. I am interested to get involved with Proto if there are available touchpoints from the EMBAs. Are you building or thinking about any space related tech, in particular space debris or space mining?  
Best, Greg
