Caroline is a PhD student in the Tectonophysics group of the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT, working with Prof. William Frank. She visited USC during spring 2020 to work on the subdaily dynamics of slow slip in Mexico. She is working on the dynamic of slow slip event combining seismic data (low-frequency earthquakes) and geodetic data (GPS time series). She will start by developping her previous work (in Mexico) to the Cascadia subduction zone.
