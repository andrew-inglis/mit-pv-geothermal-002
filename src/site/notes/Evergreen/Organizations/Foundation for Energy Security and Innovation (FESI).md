FESI’s establishment follows precedents set by the [National Park Foundation](https://www.nationalparks.org/), the [Foundation for the National Institutes of Health](https://fnih.org/) (FNIH), and many other congressionally-authorized non-profit organizations that help federal agencies achieve their missions. All of them enable their agency partners to work more easily with philanthropy, industry, and communities while guarding against conflicts of interest that might arise from such collaboration.
