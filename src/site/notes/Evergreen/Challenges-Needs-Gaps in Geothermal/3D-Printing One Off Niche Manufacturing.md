## Initial Idea From:
[[Evergreen/People/Rob Mellors\|Rob Mellors]]

## Description of venture idea
Since in the rampup of projects, we will be doing 1 off, 2 off 10 off, figure out how to manufacture complicated equipment at this scale better.

## Market needs this venture would address


## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage


## Business model


## Team


## Outstanding risks
- This is a standard thing: Prototypes, First articles, build-books

## References

A **build book for a first article** is a comprehensive document or package that provides detailed information about the manufacturing process, inspection, and validation of a first article. The first article refers to the initial product manufactured using the same processes intended for mass production, and it is inspected to ensure compliance with design specifications and requirements. The build book serves as a record and guide for this process.

## Key Components of a Build Book for a First Article

1. **Design Records**:
    
    - Includes engineering drawings, specifications, and digital product data.
        
    - Often accompanied by ballooned drawings where each design characteristic is uniquely numbered for traceability[](https://www.guthcad.com/blog/first-article-inspection.html)[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html).
        
2. **Bill of Materials (BOM)**:
    
    - Lists all materials and components used in the production of the first article[](https://aiola.ai/blog/first-article-inspection-report/)[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html).
        
3. **Manufacturing Process Documentation**:
    
    - Details the steps taken during production, including equipment used and any special processes applied[](https://tetrainspection.com/first-article-inspection/)[](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/suppliers/mfc/mfc-quality-fai-guidebook.pdf).
        
4. **Inspection Plan**:
    
    - Outlines the inspection criteria, methods, and tools used to verify compliance with design specifications[](https://aiola.ai/blog/first-article-inspection-report/)[](https://www.inspectionxpert.com/blog/how-to-create-a-first-article-inspection-report-in-5-steps).
        
5. **Dimensional Inspection Reports**:
    
    - Provides measurement data for all critical dimensions, tolerances, and features of the part using calibrated tools like Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) or other gauges[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_article_inspection)[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html).
        
6. **Material Records**:
    
    - Includes certifications or test results verifying material properties such as hardness, conductivity, or chemical composition[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html)[](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/suppliers/mfc/mfc-quality-fai-guidebook.pdf).
        
7. **Functional Test Results**:
    
    - Documents outcomes of any functional tests performed to ensure the part operates as intended[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html)[](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/eo/documents/suppliers/mfc/mfc-quality-fai-guidebook.pdf).
        
8. **Traceability Information**:
    
    - Ensures that all measurements and processes are traceable to specific equipment or personnel involved in production and inspection[](https://www.1factory.com/quality-academy/guide-first-article.html)[](https://www.inspectionxpert.com/blog/how-to-create-a-first-article-inspection-report-in-5-steps).
