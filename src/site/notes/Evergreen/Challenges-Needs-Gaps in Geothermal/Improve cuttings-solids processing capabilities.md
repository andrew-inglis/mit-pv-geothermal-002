## Description

- O&G existing technology to extract Lithium and other rare minerals - Shakers, centrifuges, dryers, etc. are employed to reduce the associated volume of wet cuttings and reduce the amount of "water" trucked away from location.
- 
Improve cuttings/solids processing capabilities to reduce transportation and disposal costs. 

- Offset drilling cost by extracting hi-

value minerals from drilling fluids/well

returns

- Improve
