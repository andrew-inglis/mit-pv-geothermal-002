## Description
Loss circulation and low ROP are the primary causes leading to high drilling costs. Though currently implemented, today's approach is very reactive and benefits / performance evaluations are done on a well- by-well basis. (one well lost due to stuck DP, could overcome results of 5 other wells "cowboyed" and drill to TD) - Air drilling (all variants) is commonly applied in O&G industry to address loss circulation and low ROP in surface/intermediate sections. This is highly applicable in highly fractured/cavernous, hard formations - UBD / Aerated Fluid Drilling approach is commonly applied in the reservoir section of O&G wells to reduce loss circulation and increase ROP

Loss circulation and the associated "drilling blind" condition typically prevent cuttings from reaching surface and with that preventing formation stratigraphy characterization. Throughout the reservoir section this gets compounded by impairing the geothermal reservoir by fines/cutting migration into the producing fractures, as well as "cooling" of the reservoir, impairing "production" from nearby wells

Inability to clean the hole or evacuate cuttings often results in stuck pipe and/or pack off. Solids concentration, particularly around the bit area and cuttings surface has a negative impact on ROP by re drilling the same rock repetitive times.

While drilling a horizontal lateral, removing cuttings is arguably the most important task to achieving drilling success. However, lost circulation (returns entering reservoir instead of returning to surface) not only damages the reservoir and permeability, but also risks cuttings bed generation that results in stuck pipe.
