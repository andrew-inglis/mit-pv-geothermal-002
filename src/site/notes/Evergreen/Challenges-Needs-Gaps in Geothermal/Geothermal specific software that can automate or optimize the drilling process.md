## Description

Geothermal operators rarely use the sophisticated software tools that could really improve the ROP in hard rocks from the planning phase. The O&G industry has a huge amount of experience in this area. There has been a lot of work done on software answer products for drilling optimization, ROP control, Auto drillers, drilling automation. All of these products could be tweaked to deliver performance gains in Geothermal.
