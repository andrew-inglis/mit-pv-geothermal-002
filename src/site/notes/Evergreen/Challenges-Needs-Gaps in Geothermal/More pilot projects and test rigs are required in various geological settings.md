## Description

To help reduce all of the pains identified in lowering drilling and completions costs and temperature management more pilot projects and test rigs are required. Those pilot projects need to be drilled in various geological settings and at different temperatures and exploiting different geothermal techniques like closed loop and EGS. The are not enough wells being drilled today to deliver a rapid jump in performance.
