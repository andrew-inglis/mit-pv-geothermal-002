## Description

Percussive drilling is a mature drilling method that requires repeated deployments in Hard Rock Geothermal conditions to verify its high ROP can be sustained in this domain. Their performance must match or surpass conventional rotary methods if it is to become the primary method of SHR drilling, but this can only be achieved with aggressive repetitions of in- field deployments. Percussive drilling combines air or mud hammer drilling with rotary drilling techniques, that have demonstrated the capacity to drill to SHR conditions, or deep into hard rock. Percussive drilling was deployed for Stn-1, Fervo and IDDP-2. High ROP rates, 20 m/hr, have been demonstrated to >6000 m, suggesting that percussive drilling could be competitive with conventional rotary methods in ROP generation through hard rock. Further testing in SHR conditions is required.
