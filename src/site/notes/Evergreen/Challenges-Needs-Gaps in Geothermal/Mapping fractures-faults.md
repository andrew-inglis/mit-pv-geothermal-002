## Description

Develop better methods of determining the distribution, density, and orientation of pre-existing and stimulated fractures to optimize overall hydraulic connectivity within the stimulated reservoir.

Understanding where the most productive faults and fractures exist and their conductivity is essential to optimizing production Surface equipment combined with downhole sensing equipment can provide real-time feedback on fracture/fault characterization that optimizes oil and gas production. The same tech could benefit geothermal developers by providing insight into the well construction process.
