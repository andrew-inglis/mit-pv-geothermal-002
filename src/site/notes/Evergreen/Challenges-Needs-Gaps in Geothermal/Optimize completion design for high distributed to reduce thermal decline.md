## Description

Optimize completion design to allow for high flow rates and distributed flow to reduce thermal decline

Concern around flow distribution over time and accelerated cooling, improving thermal decline profile can improve economics of the lower temp resources along with higher temp resources once they can be successfully accessed

Limited entry completion design ensures flow distribution into substages during high rate completions, similar workflow for stimulation on EGS and to optimize flow during production
