## Description

This is the same pain point as for drill bits. We need to see ever improving performance, increased durability, faster rates of penetration, and higher temperature ratings. New cutters are required for interbedded formations with large differences hardness between the different layers. Fast ROPs in basalts and very high compressive strength rocks. Increased stability to be able to handle vibration in the hard basement rocks. We will need to see a proven track record of PDC performance in igneous and metamorphic rocks above 400 ÂºC. We need to see the impact of thermal spallation in combination with PDC bits, the lab results look promising.

There is lots of experience in PDC cutter design in the O&G industry. This knowledge and experience needs to be pushed to new limits, creating diamond cutters or new materials that can perform in the hard basement rocks of Geothermal. This is also tied to having lots of pilot projects and test rigs where rapid iteration can be performed.
