## Description
Tortuosity in the near-wellbore region of the fracture negatively affects proppant transport and could be a source of parasitic loss in EGS. More viscous fracturing fluids should be considered in the early part of the treatment. In addition, perforation cluster location and cemented completions can play a key role to ensure fracture alignment. Background: risk factors observed in FERVO micro seismic data (horizontal hydraulic fracture)
