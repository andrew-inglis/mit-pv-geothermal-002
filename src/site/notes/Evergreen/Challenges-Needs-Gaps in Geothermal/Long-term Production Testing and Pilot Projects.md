## Description

Limited higher-temperature system characterization and extended development times for assessing reservoir quality. Long-term production testing is critical to demonstrate the economic viability of geothermal projects. More pilot projects are needed to establish proof of concept for replicable practices, along with comprehensive documentation and data curation to support knowledge sharing across the industry.

Validate long-term operability of achieving commercial rates of heat production from EGS reservoirs for sustained periods of time at several U.S. sites.

## Background

High-temperature system characterization remains limited, and extended timelines for reservoir assessment slow down the advancement of geothermal projects. Long-term production testing is crucial for demonstrating economic feasibility, but the industry often relies on theoretical data with little practical validation. More pilot projects are needed to establish proof of concept for scalable practices. However, a lack of comprehensive documentation— particularly in data curation and resource allocation— restricts shared learning and replication. Leveraging AI/ML techniques can shorten development times, but practical, real-world data is essential for accurate techno-economic assessments. Without detailed pilot project documentation, the scaling of geothermal solutions remains inefficient and uncertain.
