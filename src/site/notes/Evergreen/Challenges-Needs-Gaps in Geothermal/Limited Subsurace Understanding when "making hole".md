## Description

- Improve/increase equipment/drilling techniques alternatives to face conditions associated to EGS (deeper and uncharted) 
- Improve/increase equipment/drilling techniques alternatives to mitigate Naturally fractured, abrasive, hard nature of cap rock and igneous rocks associated complexity and risk
- Improve/increase equipment/drilling techniques alternatives to enable characterization of stratigraphic profiles often reduced by drill blind conditions 
- Lack of "hydrothermal reservoir" identification tools/seismic survey interpretation 
 - - Equipment and drilling technology limitations increase risk associated with subsurface uncertainty - Economics / cost associated with seismic surveys limits the ability forecast and plan for specific drilling challenges, and "confirm" existence of a geothermal reservoir - Technology and drilling techniques knowledge gap - Limited Subsurface area mapping - "making hole" focus operations - Better rigs and implementation of unconventional drilling techniques help to reduce the risk associated with subsurface uncertainty. - Higher demand associated to O&G wells supports development and improvement of survey tools and log interpretation.
