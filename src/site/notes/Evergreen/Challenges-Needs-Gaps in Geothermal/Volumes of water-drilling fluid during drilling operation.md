## Description

Volumes of water/drilling fluid during drilling operation can quickly become a limiting factor when severe/total loss of circulation is experienced. Access to water as well as the logistic cost can negatively impact the P&L of a well if this resource is not available. The same applies for EGS, where only 70-85% of the injected water / liquid circulated subsurface is expected to be recovered. 

Scarcity 
- This is a tough one to address without local knowledge. 
- Assuming there are no oil/gas wells proximate to this project, water for D&C will need to be secured via aquifer/surface sources. 
- Proximate Agricultural operations might provide a viable source. 
- Water used for 'frac' can be treated and reused for operations. Considerations on treatment detailed below. 

- Treatment of frac water 
* Treatment for frac water is simple, and typically minimal with regards to cost. 
* Water testing will determine types of chemistry and pump rates. * Common chemicals used incl. biocide and scale inhibitor. 
* Oxygen or Iron Scavengers are less common, but sometimes required. 
* Simple filtration may be required depending on TSS of the source water. 
- Treatment on surface (operations) 
* DAF is a great tech that is easy to operate. This treatment would be deployed if you had significant solids in the water, and/or high Iron content. Iron scales easily so removing free iron from the system is a best practice. 
* Ion Exchange works well, and is less expensive, but is designed to target specific ions. If the water had extremely elevated calcium, iron, or sulfates Ion Exchange would be an option. 

- Municipal treated waste water
