## Description

Corrosion understanding/mitigation required in Hydrothermal wells. High salinity levels in produced fluids containing salts like NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 will lead to the corrosion of completion and casing. Body of knowledge from existing Hydrothermal fields - although also some relevance to EGS and AGS. Also O&G experience in SAGD and wells with aggressive formation fluids
