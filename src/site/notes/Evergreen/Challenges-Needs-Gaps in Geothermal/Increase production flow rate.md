## Description
Increase production flow rate by reducing parasitic load to offset lower temperature for increased production 

Parasitic Load in EGS: Parasitic load is a critical concern in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), unlike in hydrothermal systems where it's less of an issue.

3D Printing and Pressure Vessels: The potential for 3D printing pressure vessels exists, but certification pathways are lacking. Current standards impede the development of smaller, more cost-effective heat exchangers.

Heat Exchanger Costs: Heat exchangers represent a significant portion of costs (up to 40%). Reducing their size and cost could greatly benefit surface operations. 

Well Size and Friction Loss: Larger well diameters (up to 12-1/4 inches) are necessary to reduce friction losses and improve economics. Current practices often use smaller pipes (4" or 7").

Coatings for Friction and Corrosion: Research into coatings that provide both corrosion resistance and friction reduction is ongoing, particularly for high-temperature applications.

Fluid Additives and Friction Reduction: Long-term strategies may include thermally stable fluid additives to reduce pipe friction, although their effectiveness in high temperatures needs further exploration.

System Analysis and Optimization: A systematic approach to program design is essential for identifying and mitigating parasitic losses. Nodal analysis can help balance fluid flow and reduce friction across the entire system.

Scaling and Corrosion Management: Addressing scaling, corrosion, and H2S issues is vital, as these factors impact overall system efficiency and longevity.

Erosion and Screening Solutions: Higher flow rates can lead to erosion, necessitating effective screening strategies to manage proppants and prevent damage. 

Iterative Improvement: The need for ongoing optimization through testing and observation, as practiced in the oil and gas sector, can guide EGS development and enhance economic viability.

Friction Reduction Strategies: Options for reducing friction during stimulation include the use of friction reducers, low-friction coatings (which are costly), and alternative materials.

Temperature Limitations: There is a need for data on temperature limitations for these coatings, with some existing research focusing on corrosion and friction reduction.

Cost-Effective Solutions: Utilizing friction reduction chemicals may offer a more economical solution, potentially in combination with coatings and treated fluids.

Impact on Completions: Proper wellbore placement and quality during completions are crucial, as deficiencies can lead to increased friction losses and subsequent production issues.
