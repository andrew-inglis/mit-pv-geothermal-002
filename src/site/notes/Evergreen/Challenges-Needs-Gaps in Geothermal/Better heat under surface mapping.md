## Description of need
"Figure 2.2 illustrates that, at the present stage of the analysis, there are still large geographic areas that are under-sampled with respect to the 8 km grid interval, such that the contours are not well constrained in places where the data are sparse. For example, Kentucky and Wisconsin have no conventional heat-flow data at all (although there are some BHT data points), and there are large gaps in several other areas, especially the eastern part of the United States. Areas in the Appalachian basin may have low thermal conductivity and high heat flow (as is the case in northwestern Pennsylvania), but data are limited in this region. Heat flow for AAPG database BHT points in the eastern United States was not calculated, due to the small and generally scattered nature of the drilling there and limited thermal conductivity information. The deeper wells were used in the preparation of the temperature maps, however."

## Why is it  a need
Knowing where to put the well for productivity is important
May open up speculators to buy land in preparation for Geothermal wells.
