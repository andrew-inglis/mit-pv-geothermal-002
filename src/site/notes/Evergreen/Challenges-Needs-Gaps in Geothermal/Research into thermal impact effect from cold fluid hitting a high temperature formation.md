## Description

The slow ROP's normally associated with hard, crystalline basement rocks could be significantly improved if cold drilling fluid hits very hot rocks. This thermal impact causes a weakening of the crystal lattice and enables rock to be more easily drilled by conventional mechanical bits. This is not a method that has been studied or applied in O&G because the temperature differential between the fluid and the rock is not normally significant. They do however have the expertise and the test equipment to study the effect of thermal impact and see if it could deliver a valid increase in ROP
