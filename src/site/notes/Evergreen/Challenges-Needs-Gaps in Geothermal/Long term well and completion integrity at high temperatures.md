## Description
Long term GT well integrity performance is a new field for EGS and AGS but well established for Hydro Thermal , more data, analytics and modelling required. Conventional O&G has good knowledge experimented with special materials, SS and titanium also with tubular coatings and chemical inhibitors, seals and elastomers. Cementing is weak area for high temperatures

## Teams working on it
