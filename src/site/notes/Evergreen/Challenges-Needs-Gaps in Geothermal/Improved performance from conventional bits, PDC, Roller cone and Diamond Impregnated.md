## Description
We need to see ever improving performance, increased durability, faster rates of penetration, and higher temperature ratings. New bit designs and cutters are required for interbedded formations with large differences hardness between the different layers. Fast ROPs in basalts and very high compressive strength rocks. Increased stability to be able to handle vibration in the hard basement rocks. We will need to see a proven track record of PDC performance in igneous and metamorphic rocks above 400 ºC. We need to see the impact of thermal spallation in combination with PDC bits, the lab results look promising. Roller cone bits rated to 288 °C performed successfully at high temperatures on the IDDP high temperature projects in Iceland but they should be phased out because of low ROPs. PDC drill bits have shown massive performance jumps on the FORGE project and most recently on the FERVO location. Current designs are delivering runs of more than 900 M at 30 m/hr. in hard crystalline granite. Performance in igneous rocks with layers of high differential strength is still relatively unknown but performance in New Zealand with large PDC bits was very promising. The current state of PDC performance has already significantly changed the economics of SHR projects by reducing the number of days on location significantly. Drill bits are all steerable and the current temperature limitation of PDC bits is the “O” Rings holding in the nozzles which is close to 400 °C.
