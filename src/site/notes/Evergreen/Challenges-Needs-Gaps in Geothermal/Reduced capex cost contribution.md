Drilling costs for geothermal are much higher relative to O&G well costs. Costs are broken down into time- based costs and fixed costs. Reducing time-costs thru drilling performance and reducing fixed costs thru supply chain efficiencies and material procurement. On time-based costs, faster drilling rates and more efficient rig operations reduce exposure to time-based costs. On fixed costs, leveraging volume discounts, improving drilling techniques and employing innovative materials can reduce fixed cost exposure. Fit for purpose well design and operations/support infrastructure has positively impact drilling and completion cost in O&G (Multi-well pads, drilling mud/cement mixing plants, etc.)

Initial investment accounts for about 80% of electricity generation costs, with the remainder associated with fixed operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses.

O&M expenses for geothermal plants are relatively high due to the necessity of carefully managing production and potentially drilling additional wells to maintain required performance over a project’s lifetime.

Power plant equipment and construction accounts for 40-60% of total conventional geothermal investment costs. These costs can vary significantly, depending on the size and complexity of a power plant’s configuration. Large, direct-steam and flash plants utilising high-temperature resources typically have the lowest costs per MW, followed by binary, hybrid and other complex designs.

The second-largest item in the investment cost breakdown is production and injection well-drilling and steamfield development, comprising 30-45% of the total conventional geothermal project investment. Geological conditions, resource quality and drilling success rates can vary drastically, impacting overall investment needs.

Permitting, geothermal resource exploration and test-well drilling make up another 10-15% of investment costs. This predevelopment stage represents the highest project risk, as it can lead to delays and cost increases due to lengthy permitting, unsuccessful geothermal resource exploration or unforeseen technical challenges. Risk in this phase is influenced by the complexity and duration of permitting procedures, the availability of sound geological data and the number of test wells.

The remaining 5-10% of the total cost is related to engineering, management and contingencies. In addition, in remote areas where many high-quality geothermal resources are located, constructing new roads and transporting materials over long distances can have a significant impact on overall investment costs.

In most cases, only a limited number of investors are willing to take the risks involved with the resource exploration and well-drilling phases, resulting in a high cost of capital, which drastically impacts the competitiveness of geothermal power.

For instance, doubling the weighted average cost of capital from 5% to 10% can increase the overall LCOE of a geothermal plant by about 40%.
