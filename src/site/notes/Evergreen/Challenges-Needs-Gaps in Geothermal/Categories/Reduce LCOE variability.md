## Description of idea

There are some aspects of geothermal wells that have an greater affect on the $/kWh than others. From [[Inputs/Papers-Documents-Publications-Articles/2006-11-01 The Future of Geothermal Energy\|2006-11-01 The Future of Geothermal Energy]],

So what you would do is work on tech that reduces the variability of the $/MWh.

That ends up being the Flow Rate of the Production Well.
