## Description of need

cost of drilling is a major component of cost.

This is out of date. in 2025, there has been a lot of improvement and learning curves.





## Why is it  a need

In the longer term, particularly when lower-grade EGS resources are being developed, more revolutionary approaches could have a large impact on lowering EGS drilling costs, in that they could increase both ROP and bit lifetime as well as facilitate under-reaming. For example, such approaches would reduce the number of times the drill string would have to be removed from the hole to change drill bits. Three revolutionary drilling technology examples include hydrothermal flame spallation and fusion drilling (Potter and Tester, 1998), chemically enhanced drilling (Polizotti, 2003), and metal shot abrasive-assisted drilling (Curlett and Geddes, 2006). Each of these methods augments or avoids the traditional method of penetration based on crushing and grinding rock with a hardened material in the drill bit itself, thereby reducing the tendency of the system to wear or fail.
