Faster iteration to reduce costs, accelerate optimization, and increase scale

In the last decade, the O&G industry has made significant strides in performance and economics through rapid drilling and iteration. However, challenges remain in validating high-temperature systems with long-term production data. Data-driven decision making and modeling can accelerate system optimization, but more pilots and projects are needed for efficient scaling. Table 2 below shows specific pain points under this category, but finding solutions to pain points in other categories can also support the acceleration of pilots and projects.
