## Description

Need for Open Database: An open database is essential to understand water properties, scaling risks, and treatment options, as these factors vary by water source, mineral content, and solubility.

Water Source Impact: Sourcing water from shallow areas presents unique challenges, including temperature-related issues and scaling that can affect equipment like heat exchangers and artificial fractures.

Surface vs. Downhole Management: Addressing water-related issues at the surface is preferable because downhole temperatures complicate scaling and equipment degradation.

Minimizing sand and solid particles on the surface is crucial to prevent equipment failure.

Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment: Surface treatments for water quality are generally cost-effective when properly maintained. Ongoing education and cost feasibility analyses are necessary as water management becomes increasingly important in production operations.

Data Resources: Existing databases, such as those from the USGS, provide valuable information on water chemistry and geochemical reactions, though they can be challenging to navigate

Efforts are underway to modernize thermodynamic modeling for geothermal and CCS applications. Sensor Requirements: There is a need for sensors capable of withstanding high temperatures (up to 450Â°F) for effective monitoring. Innovative placement of sensors upstream of heat exchangers has shown to be effective. 

Future Considerations: As the industry matures, greater emphasis on water management will be essential, particularly concerning the thermal degradation of geothermal systems and the treatment of downhole water. Regulatory Requirements: States mandate reporting to address concerns related to water pollution, highlighting the need for effective monitoring. Data and Modeling Gaps: While good sampling capabilities and thermodynamic modeling exist, there is a significant gap in understanding the kinetics of solids formation. Integrated Asset Modeling: Emphasis on integrated asset modeling to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making. USGS Resources: Madeleine Blonds from USGS oversees a produced water database and a geochemical reactions database. USGS is also developing a modern thermodynamics modeling package focused on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and geothermal applications, moving away from hydrocarbon-centric models. Shallow Water Data: The USGS National Water Information System provides valuable data for groundwater research. Kinetics Compilation: USGS has compiled kinetics models to predict solid precipitation, which is essential for managing produced water issues. Open Source Databases: Resources, including an international thermodynamics database managed by Livermore (Jim Polandry), are available as open source for broader accessibility.
