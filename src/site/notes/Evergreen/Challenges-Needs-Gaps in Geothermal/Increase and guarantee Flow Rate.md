## Description of need
Develop and validate methods to achieve a twofold to fourfold increase in production well-flow rate from current levels, while maintaining sufficient contact with the rock within the reservoir and ensuring sufficient reservoir lifetime.

## Why is it  a need

Table 1.3 gives estimated values for six representative EGS sites for the United States, showing the dramatic effect that reservoir fluid flow rate has on LEC, going from an initial value of 20 kg/s per well to 80 kg/s per well for the two base cases shown.
