From Perplexity:

The Energy Innovation Center in Oklahoma City has a rich history of innovation and collaboration in the energy sector:

1. Conception and Opening:  
    The facility was conceived in 2013 and opened in 2016 as the GE Global Research Center for the oil and gas industry[1](https://www.bakerhughes.com/company/news/bhge-relaunches-rd-center-drive-speed-innovation-and-commercialization). It was initially built at a cost of over $110 million[5](https://www.mcafeetaft.com/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-to-oklahoma-state-university/).
    
2. Ownership Changes:
    

- Initially part of GE Oil & Gas
    
- Became part of Baker Hughes following the merger with GE in July 2017[1](https://www.bakerhughes.com/company/news/bhge-relaunches-rd-center-drive-speed-innovation-and-commercialization)
    
- Renamed to Baker Hughes Oil & Gas Technology Center in 2014[1](https://www.bakerhughes.com/company/news/bhge-relaunches-rd-center-drive-speed-innovation-and-commercialization)
    

1. Relaunch and Expansion:  
    On June 25, 2018, Baker Hughes relaunched the center as the BHGE Energy Innovation Center of North America[1](https://www.bakerhughes.com/company/news/bhge-relaunches-rd-center-drive-speed-innovation-and-commercialization). This relaunch expanded its focus from traditional R&D to launching new products and services as startups, functioning as an innovation accelerator for the energy industry[1](https://www.bakerhughes.com/company/news/bhge-relaunches-rd-center-drive-speed-innovation-and-commercialization).
    
2. Facilities and Capabilities:  
    The center spans approximately 125,000 square feet of commercial and laboratory space, including a structured parking garage[5](https://www.mcafeetaft.com/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-to-oklahoma-state-university/). It houses multiple laboratories and research facilities for various engineering disciplines[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/).
    
3. Donation to Oklahoma State University:  
    In July 2020, Baker Hughes donated the Energy Innovation Center building to Oklahoma State University (OSU)[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/). This donation established a technology collaboration between Baker Hughes and OSU, bringing industry and academic representatives together under one roof[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/).
    
4. Current Status:  
    The center continues to operate as a collaborative space, with OSU managing the building and occupying the fourth floor, while Baker Hughes maintains laboratories on the first floor and occupies the entire fifth floor[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/). Both entities share common areas such as the showroom, auditorium, and conference spaces[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/).
    

The Energy Innovation Center remains a hub for technological advancement and collaboration in the energy sector, now serving as a bridge between industry and academia in Oklahoma City's Innovation District[3](https://www.greateroklahomacity.com/news/2020/07/29/innovation/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-building-to-osu/)[5](https://www.mcafeetaft.com/baker-hughes-donates-energy-innovation-center-to-oklahoma-state-university/).



## Connection with [[Evergreen/People/Harold Hamm\|Harold Hamm]]

[[Evergreen/People/Harold Hamm\|Harold Hamm]] has a significant connection to the Energy Innovation Center in Oklahoma City, which was formerly owned by Baker Hughes. In December 2021, Harold Hamm, through his Harold Hamm Foundation, along with Continental Resources (a company he founded), made a combined donation of $50 million to establish the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University[1](https://news.okstate.edu/articles/communications/2021/historic_donation_establishes_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html)[3](https://news.okstate.edu/magazines/state-magazine/articles/2022/spring/visionary_donations_establish_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html).

The Hamm Institute is now located in the building that was formerly known as OSU Discovery, at 300 NE 9th St. in the Oklahoma City Innovation District. This is the same building that previously housed the Baker Hughes Energy Innovation Center[3](https://news.okstate.edu/magazines/state-magazine/articles/2022/spring/visionary_donations_establish_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html)[6](https://www.thecrudelife.com/2022/12/21/year-in-review-harold-hamm-says-its-a-new-day-in-industry-talks-carbon-solutions-energy-education-and-independence/).

Key points about Harold Hamm's involvement:

1. The institute's mission is to educate the next generation of energy leaders and cement Oklahoma's legacy as a global energy leader[3](https://news.okstate.edu/magazines/state-magazine/articles/2022/spring/visionary_donations_establish_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html).
    
2. The facility hosts symposiums, speakers, energy summits, and global energy leadership conversations[3](https://news.okstate.edu/magazines/state-magazine/articles/2022/spring/visionary_donations_establish_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html).
    
3. It will eventually house the Oklahoma Hall of Energy Legends Interactive Museum, showcasing the history of Oklahoma's energy leaders[3](https://news.okstate.edu/magazines/state-magazine/articles/2022/spring/visionary_donations_establish_hamm_institute_for_american_energy_at_oklahoma_state_university.html).
    
4. Harold Hamm serves as the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Hamm Institute[4](https://hamminstitute.org/about/our-board/board-of-directors.html).
    
5. The institute aims to merge education, research, and policy to redefine the energy landscape[5](https://hamminstitute.org/about/about-the-institute/).
    

Harold Hamm's involvement represents a significant shift in the building's purpose, transforming it from a corporate research center to an educational and collaborative space focused on advancing American energy innovation and leadership[6](https://www.thecrudelife.com/2022/12/21/year-in-review-harold-hamm-says-its-a-new-day-in-industry-talks-carbon-solutions-energy-education-and-independence/)[8](https://www.thecrudelife.com/2025/02/16/the-crude-life-vault-harold-hamm-says-its-a-new-day-in-industry-talks-carbon-solutions/).
