We are seeing that there is a government / startup company feedback loop going on, and the funding is flowing.

Per the DOEs new [[Evergreen/Notes/Adoption Readiness Level\|Adoption Readiness Level]] setup (discussed here: [[Inputs/Podcasts-Videos/2024-10-16 The DOE has gotten serious about technology commercialization-Volts podcast\|2024-10-16 The DOE has gotten serious about technology commercialization-Volts podcast]]), these companies are paying for new inventions through this relationship of the govt giving them funding for demonstration and deployment.

The organizations receiving funding, how much each is to receive, and what each project is expected to do are as follows:

- Clemson University, $4.880 million, to develop an AI-enabled, photoacoustic imaging tool for high-temperature and high-pressure well logging in order to assess geothermal well integrity without active cooling.
- Innovative Downhole Solutions Inc., $2.5 million, to develop a durable ultrasonic measurement tool capable of operating for 24 hours in high-temperature geothermal environments to assess wellbore construction materials and practices.
- Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, $2 million, to develop a tool for geothermal borehole integrity evaluation, designed to assess wellbore integrity in extreme conditions without the need for down hole electronics.
- Los Alamos National Laboratory, $3.674 million, to develop a high-resolution acoustics-based tool to provide high-fidelity data for evaluating EGS components under extreme conditions.
- Schlumberger Technology Corp., $10 million, to develop a wireline tractor-conveyed system for long-term integrity modeling of cement and casing.
- Project Development Solutions, Inc., $7.899 million, to conduct a RTES demonstration project at Kern Front Oil Field in Bakersfield, Calif., pairing subsurface geothermal reservoirs with a steam system and process heat off-taker.

The idea is to connect with all of these funded efforts, and see what they are working on, and if any new tech is needed as they are moving through their development.
