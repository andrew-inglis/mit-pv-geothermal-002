## Description of approach
There are several ways that the commercial liftoff goals of reducing cost and cost variability or higher MW/well pair can happen:
1. new technological advances
2. learning curves

We have been focusing on #1, but perhaps we should explore #2 as well


## Where did the idea come from

The [[Evergreen/Companies/Vertical Integration/Fervo\|Fervo]] CEO [[Evergreen/People/Tim Latimer\|Tim Latimer]] talks a lot about the learning curves in the space.
Then [[Evergreen/People/David Cohen-Tanugi\|David Cohen-Tanugi]] sent an article:

- [x] read the article

Because of these two things coming up from two places, had the idea to focus on it as a place to improve, rather than a competing method of supporting geothermal's commercial liftoff.
