Oil and gas service providers are also engaged in geothermal developments and operations, including drilling-related services, completions, wellsite and downhole measurements, and laboratory studies. In fact, several such providers with core competencies in oil and gas have diversified into providing specialised equipment for geothermal operations. For example, [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal integration non-drilling/SLB (Schlumberger)\|SLB (Schlumberger)]] was granted USD 10 million to develop a system to monitor the long-term integrity of completions in geothermal wells, and other companies including [[Weatherford\|Weatherford]], [[Expro\|Expro]], and [[Halliburton\|Halliburton]] are involved in various geothermal operations, including managing flow assurance, high pressures and temperatures to improve well performance. Similarly, Baker Hughes has  established a consortium to develop and test next-generation geothermal-based power production. Drilling contractors can also play an important role in geothermal asset development, with Helmerich & Payne and Nabors, for example, investing in a number of geothermal companies.


_The industry is also well placed to participate in the research and development needed to develop next-generation materials, chemicals and stimulation techniques._
