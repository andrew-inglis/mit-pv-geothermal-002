The Allam Cycle, also known as the Allam-Fetvedt Cycle, is an innovative power generation process that converts carbonaceous fuels into thermal energy while simultaneously capturing carbon dioxide and water emissions[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allam_power_cycle)[3](https://www.cceguide.org/en/technologies/remove/power-electricity-generation/carbon-capture-alternative-technologies/allam-cycle/). This cycle uses a high-pressure, recuperated Brayton cycle with a transcritical CO2 working fluid and oxy-fuel combustion[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allam_power_cycle).

Key features of the Allam Cycle include:

1. Oxy-combustion: The process burns fuel (such as natural gas or coal syngas) with pure oxygen instead of air, resulting in a simpler emissions profile[6](http://www.petro-online.com/article/measurement-and-testing/14/sbh4-gmbh/the-allam-cycle-clean-power-from-natural-gas-with-integrated-carbon-capture/3290).
    
2. Supercritical CO2 working fluid: The cycle employs supercritical CO2 as the primary working fluid, which is held at or above its critical temperature and pressure[3](https://www.cceguide.org/en/technologies/remove/power-electricity-generation/carbon-capture-alternative-technologies/allam-cycle/).
    
3. High efficiency: The Allam Cycle aims to produce electricity at a lower cost than conventional power generation methods[4](https://letaustralia.com.au/projects/allam-cycle/).
    
4. Integrated carbon capture: The process inherently captures nearly all CO2 emissions, making it a near-zero emission technology[4](https://letaustralia.com.au/projects/allam-cycle/)[6](http://www.petro-online.com/article/measurement-and-testing/14/sbh4-gmbh/the-allam-cycle-clean-power-from-natural-gas-with-integrated-carbon-capture/3290).
    
5. Valuable byproducts: In addition to power generation, the cycle can produce high-purity CO2 for industrial use or sequestration, as well as other products like hydrogen, ammonia, and fertilizers[4](https://letaustralia.com.au/projects/allam-cycle/).
    

The Allam Cycle has garnered significant attention in the energy industry, with a 50 MWth natural gas-fed test facility validated in La Porte, Texas, in May 2018[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allam_power_cycle). It is considered a promising technology for achieving low-carbon power generation while maintaining cost-competitiveness[8](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/carbon-capture-and-the-allam-cycle-the-future-of-electricity-or-a-carbon-pipeline-dream/).
