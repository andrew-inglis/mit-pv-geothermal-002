## Initial Idea From:
- reading [[Inputs/Papers-Documents-Publications-Articles/Conferences/Stanford Geothermal Workshop/By Year/2003 Stanford Geothermal Workshop Talks\|2003 Stanford Geothermal Workshop Talks]]
- geochemistry need verified by [[Evergreen/People/Terra Rogers\|Terra Rogers]]


## Description of venture idea

There may be bacterial that can help with
[[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/Scaling and deposition prediction\|Scaling and deposition prediction]]
There may be bacteria that can be put in the working fluid to keep the ungunking

[[Keeping fracture cracks open\|Keeping fracture cracks open]]
The fractures that are formed in EGS are either just created, or re-opened fractures that have that were "mineralized shut"
In order to keep them open in some cases, may be valuable to use rock eating bacteria.

What we would do then, is to have a service that checks the geochemistry of the working fluid, and continually puts in the right types of bacteria or other chemicals. 

## Market needs this venture would address
[[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/Better working fluids\|Better working fluids]]
Keeping reservoirs open in a more cost effective way

## Technical capabilities this venture might leverage


## Business model
IP on chemicals and methods
Use chemical contract manufacturer
Maybe suite of sensing tech? Data collection and knowledge base for chemical compositions

## Team
[[Evergreen/People/Shuhei Ono\|Shuhei Ono]]

## Outstanding risks
