## Description of capability
Fouling results in energy inefficiency, loss of heat exchange, equipment failures and expensive downtime. Conventional coatings are focused on corrosion mitigation and have limited effectiveness in high temperature / extreme chemical environments.

Mike Nour in the [[Evergreen/MIT Departments-Labs-Centers/PSFC\|PSFC]] has developed a PVD applied coating that can be applied on metal, oxide, and ceramic surfaces that prevents fouling with many fluids and is most effective in high temperature environments. The coating has been tested in nuclear, turbulent, and radiative environments proving on a long-term scale (6-month) durability and effectiveness throughout the test.
