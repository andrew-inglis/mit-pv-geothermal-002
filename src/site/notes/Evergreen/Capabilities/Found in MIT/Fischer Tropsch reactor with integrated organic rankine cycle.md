## Description of capability
- ###### [Fischer Tropsch reactor with integrated organic rankine cycle](https://patents.justia.com/patent/8889747)
    
    **Patent number:** 8889747
    
    **Abstract:** A process for recovering heat uses a product stream from a Fischer Tropsch synthesis reactor as the coolant in the same Fischer Tropsch reactor. This stream is then used as the working fluid in an associated organic Rankine cycle. In this manner, the waste heat from the Fischer Tropsch reactor can be efficiently converted into shaft work within the Fischer Tropsch plant. The Fischer Tropsch fluid can then be recycled into the plant product stream.
