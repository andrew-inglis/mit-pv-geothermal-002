Estimating the recoverable fraction of any underground resource is inherently speculative, whether it is for oil or gas, geothermal energy, or a specific mineral. Typically, some type of reservoir simulation model is used to estimate how much can be extracted. To reduce errors, predicted results are validated with field data when available. This type of “history matching” is commonly used in reservoir analysis.

Drilling records for geothermal wells do not exist in sufficient quantity or detail for making such projections. In recent years, there have been fewer than 100 geothermal wells drilled per year in the United States and very few of them are deeper than 2,800 m (9,000 ft), which provides no direct measure of well costs for deeper EGS targets for the long term.
