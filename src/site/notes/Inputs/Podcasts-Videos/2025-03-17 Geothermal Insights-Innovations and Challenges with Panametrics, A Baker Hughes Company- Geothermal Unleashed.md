## **Panametrics' Role in Geothermal Energy**

## **Technological Contributions**

1. **Ultrasonic Flow Meters**:
    
    - Panametrics offers both clamp-on and inline ultrasonic flow meters, which are well-suited for geothermal applications due to their ability to handle high temperatures, harsh environments, and challenging flow conditions.
        
    - Clamp-on meters are non-intrusive, requiring no pipe modifications, minimizing maintenance needs, and avoiding issues like corrosion or fouling. This makes them ideal for measuring brine, cooling water, and saturated steam.
        
    - Inline meters, such as the XGS 868i steam flow meter, provide accurate measurements for geothermal steam applications while minimizing pressure drops and maintenance requirements.
        
2. **Process Analyzers**:
    
    - In addition to flow meters, Panametrics offers process analyzers that complement geothermal operations by ensuring accurate monitoring of various parameters critical for efficiency and safety.
        
3. **Adaptability to Harsh Conditions**:
    
    - The company’s ultrasonic technology is particularly effective in handling geothermal fluids that contain impurities, high mineral content, and corrosive elements. This reduces downtime and maintenance compared to traditional flow meters like electromagnetic or differential pressure meters.
        

## **Commercial Differentiation**

- Panametrics distinguishes itself through its ability to provide tailored solutions for specific geothermal applications. It combines its measurement expertise with Baker Hughes' broader capabilities in drilling, reservoir management, and digital technologies.
    
- The company also supports hybrid energy systems that integrate geothermal with other renewable sources like biomass or solar, showcasing its versatility across the energy transition landscape.
    

## **Support Services**

- Panametrics emphasizes end-to-end customer support by:
    
    - Offering customized solutions based on detailed process assessments.
        
    - Providing training, on-site support, and ongoing technical assistance.
        
    - Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards (e.g., Bureau of Land Management requirements in the U.S.).
        

## **Success Stories**

1. **Brine Measurement**:
    
    - A geothermal plant transitioned from failing electromagnetic and differential pressure meters to Panametrics’ clamp-on ultrasonic flow meters. This eliminated frequent shutdowns for maintenance and calibration while improving operational efficiency.
        
2. **Steam Measurement**:
    
    - Another plant replaced traditional Annubar flow meters with Panametrics’ steam flow meters to address issues like fouling and frequent cleaning operations. This reduced downtime and eliminated time-consuming compliance reporting.
        

## **Future Trends and Innovations**

- Panametrics is preparing for advancements in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) by refreshing product lines and introducing new product innovations.
    
- Modular designs (e.g., plug-and-play skids) are being explored to simplify deployment in geothermal projects.
    
- Integration of data logging capabilities within flow meters supports real-time monitoring and optimization of geothermal wells.
    

## **Relevance to Geothermal Energy**

Panametrics’ technologies directly address key challenges in geothermal operations:

- Managing harsh environments with high temperatures and corrosive fluids.
    
- Reducing operational costs by minimizing maintenance and downtime.
    
- Supporting compliance with regulatory standards through reliable measurement solutions.
    

By leveraging its expertise in ultrasonic technology and Baker Hughes’ broader energy portfolio, Panametrics positions itself as a key player in the geothermal industry’s growth within the global energy transition.
