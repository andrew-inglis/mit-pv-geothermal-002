## Notes
from Perplexity:

Blake Wood, co-founder of 400C Energy, discusses enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and the use of hydraulic fracturing technologies to improve the permeability of geothermal assets. Traditionally, geothermal assets involved drilling wells into hydrothermal systems without fracturing, but EGS allows unlocking energy in hot, dry rock everywhere.

Wood's company focuses on using sliding sleeve completion technology, initially developed for high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) oil and gas reservoirs, in geothermal applications. Sliding sleeves offer advantages over plug and perf methods, including single-point entry fracturing which can help create better fracture connections between injection and producer wells. 400C Energy has acquired land in Utah, near existing geothermal projects, and plans to use an existing well on the property for pilot drilling programs. The company is currently working on securing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and funding for their pilot project.

- **Introduction to 400C Energy and Blake Wood:**
    
    - Blake Wood, co-founder of 400C Energy, discusses his background and the company's focus on geothermal energy.
        
- **Blake's Background:**
    
    - Early career in oil and gas, including international drilling engineering experience.
        
    - Involvement with hydraulic fracturing and sliding sleeve technology at Shell.
        
    - Co-founding Eight Sigma Energy Services to develop advanced sliding sleeve systems.
        
- **Sliding Sleeve Completion Technology:**
    
    - Explanation of hydraulic fracturing and the need for it in low-permeability reservoirs.
        
    - Comparison of sliding sleeves vs. plug and perf methods for isolating well sections during fracking.
        
    - Sliding sleeves as structural casing members with valves, opened by dropping balls.
        
    - Plug and perf involves setting plugs and using explosives for perforations.
        
    - Discussion of reservoir-dependent usage, with sliding sleeves generally yielding better production.
        
    - Eight Sigma's installations worldwide, particularly in the Middle East and India.
        
- **Transition to Geothermal and EGS (Enhanced Geothermal Systems):**
    
    - Interest in geothermal energy and recognition of the applicability of sliding sleeve technology.
        
    - Development of sliding sleeves for high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) reservoirs.
        
    - EGS defined as using hydraulic fracturing to improve permeability in geothermal assets.
        
    - Traditional geothermal vs. EGS: EGS unlocks energy in hot dry rock, which is more widely available.
        
- **400C Energy's Focus and Strategy:**
    
    - Focused on acquiring land in Utah (Beaver County) near FORGE and other geothermal projects.
        
    - Adapting oil and gas technology for geothermal applications, including upsizing the technology.
        
    - Strategic location near existing geothermal development and a power plant with available capacity.
        
    - An existing geothermal well on the land will be used for pilot drilling programs.
        
- **Plug and Perf vs. Sliding Sleeves in EGS:**
    
    - Sliding sleeves offer single-point entry fracturing, while plug and perf involve multiple fracture points (clusters).
        
    - Stress shadowing: Multiple fractures created simultaneously can inhibit optimal fracture propagation, which is bad when trying to intersect a secondary well in EGS.
        
    - Single-point entry allows stress relief and better control over fracture direction for improved connectivity between wells.
        
    - Surface equipment requirements: Sliding sleeves require less horsepower, sand storage, and water storage compared to plug and perf.
        
    - Sliding sleeves eliminate the need for wireline, explosives, and extensive personnel.
        
- **Advantages of Sliding Sleeves:**
    
    - High-temperature rating suitable for super-hot rock geothermal resources (up to 400Â°C).
        
    - Integration of inflow control devices to manage flow and prevent thermal breakthrough.
        
- **Current Challenges and Next Steps:**
    
    - Securing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and funding for the pilot project.
        
    - Pilot well is needed to demonstrate viability and secure PPAs.
        
    - Fundraising efforts are underway and showing promising levels of interest.
        
    - The biggest challenge has been acquiring land, which has now been accomplished.
