## Breakthrough Announcement

- Fervo Energy claims a breakthrough in enhanced geothermal technology
- Uses fracking-like techniques to tap into hot, dry rocks previously inaccessible
- Allows geothermal energy production in areas beyond traditional geothermal hotspots

## Technical Details

- Involves drilling horizontal wells and fracturing rock to create larger heat extraction areas
- Aims to access the ~98% of heat stored in hot, dry rock formations
- Potential depths around 2.3 kilometers, with temperatures between 100-175Â°C

## Potential and Limitations

- Current global geothermal capacity is around 16 gigawatts
- Not a complete energy solution, but potentially valuable for:
    
    - Complementing nuclear and renewable energy
    - Providing dispatchable, low-carbon power
    - Offering localized energy generation
    

## Challenges

- Potential seismic risks from rock fracturing
- Limited power density
- Thermal resource depletion in specific locations
- Efficiency around 10-20% due to lower temperatures

## Promising Aspects

- Leverages existing oil/gas drilling technologies
- Potentially lower barriers to implementation
- Interesting potential for pairing with nuclear energy
- Could provide valuable grid support and peaking services
