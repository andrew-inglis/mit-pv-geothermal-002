The episode ofÂ _Shift Key_, hosted by Robinson Meyer and Jesse Jenkins, explores the challenges and innovations in developing data centers in 2025, particularly in the context of energy demands and decarbonization. The discussion features Peter Freed, a former Director of Energy Strategy at Meta and current advisor on clean energy and data center projects.

## Key Topics Discussed:

1. **Energy Challenges for Data Centers**:
    
    - Data centers are increasingly constrained by power availability, with energy needs growing due to AI-driven computing demands.
        
    - Historically, data centers accounted for 2-4% of U.S. electricity consumption, but AI and hyperscale data centers are pushing this higher.
        
    - Developers now prioritize "power-first" approaches, seeking locations with reliable energy sources before building infrastructure.
        
2. **Evolving Data Center Design**:
    
    - Modern "hyperscale" data centers typically require 200 MW of capacity, equivalent to powering 200,000 homes.
        
    - Mega-campuses (5-6 GW) are emerging but face significant challenges due to infrastructure, labor, and utility constraints.
        
    - Cooling systems are critical to managing heat generated by high-performance GPUs used in AI. Innovations include direct-to-chip cooling and evaporative cooling systems.
        
3. **Water Usage Trade-offs**:
    
    - Cooling systems often rely on water, creating trade-offs between water consumption and energy efficiency.
        
    - Advanced water treatment allows for recycling within facilities, though some water is inevitably lost through evaporation.
        
4. **Geographic Shifts in Data Center Development**:
    
    - Traditional hubs like Northern Virginia are becoming saturated. Developers are exploring new regions with available power and supportive policies (e.g., Louisiana).
        
    - AI training reduces the need for low-latency connections to internet backbones, enabling greater geographic flexibility.
        
5. **Future Outlook**:
    
    - The industry is balancing scalability with sustainability while addressing power and water constraints.
        
    - AI-driven computing is seen as transformative, potentially rivaling the invention of the internet in its impact on society.
        

The conversation highlights the complex interplay between real estate, utilities, and technology in shaping the future of data centers amidst global efforts to decarbonize.
