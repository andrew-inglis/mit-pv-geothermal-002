## Notes

From Perplexity:

This panel discussion focused on challenging global penetration assumptions for geothermal energy in the 2050 energy mix. Key points from the conversation include:

## Current Modeling and Assumptions

- Most energy models currently ignore or underestimate geothermal's potential, often lumping it into "other" categories.
- Solar's rapid cost declines have made it the dominant focus in many models, overshadowing other technologies like geothermal.
- Models tend to favor the cheapest options, which currently include solar, wind, batteries, and natural gas.

## Geothermal's Potential and Advantages

- Geothermal has a multi-terawatt scale potential that is often overlooked.
- It can provide baseload power and heat, complementing intermittent renewables like solar and wind.
- Direct use of geothermal heat may be more efficient than converting it to electricity in many applications.

## Market Development and Challenges

- Geothermal needs better market development strategies, similar to how LNG expanded globally.
- Emerging markets present significant opportunities for geothermal deployment, especially in countries with high energy prices and suitable geology.
- Public distrust of drilling and fracking could be an obstacle, requiring education and potentially new terminology.

## Policy and Investment

- The Inflation Reduction Act in the US has helped level the playing field for geothermal, but more support is needed.
- Standardized resource assessment methods for geothermal could help unlock financing.
- More capital needs to be directed towards geothermal research, development, and deployment.

## Future Outlook

- Panelists' estimates for geothermal's share of the global energy mix by 2050 ranged from less than 1% in a pessimistic scenario to as high as 25% in an optimistic one.
- Key factors influencing geothermal's growth will include technological advancements, cost reductions, market development, and addressing the talent shortage in the industry.
