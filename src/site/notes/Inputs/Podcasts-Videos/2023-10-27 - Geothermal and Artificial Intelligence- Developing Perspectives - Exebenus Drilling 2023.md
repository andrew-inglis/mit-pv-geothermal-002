- [[Evergreen/People/Ghazal Izadi\|Ghazal Izadi]], Chief Operating Officer, XGS Energy

## Notes

From Perplexity:

This panel discussion focused on market shaping and the future of geothermal energy, featuring experts from academia, industry, and policy. Here are the key points:

## Market Shaping

- Market shaping leverages private sector and market incentives to deliver innovations society needs, recognizing that markets may not have the right incentives without intervention.
- It aims to bridge the gap between social value and private returns for innovations.
- Examples include advanced market commitments for vaccines and cap-and-trade markets for carbon emissions.

## Geothermal Energy's Importance

- Google sees geothermal as crucial for achieving its 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, as it provides firm, clean power around the clock.
- Geothermal complements other renewable sources like wind and solar in a portfolio approach to clean energy.

## Demand Aggregation and Corporate Involvement

- Demand aggregation from multiple companies can help address the "valley of death" for first-of-a-kind projects.
- Corporate buyers can provide crucial demand signals and off-take agreements to help finance new projects.

## Policy and Government Role

- Government can support geothermal through technology-neutral policies, permitting reform, and valuing 24/7 clean power.
- Both federal and state governments can play important roles in incentivizing and unlocking geothermal potential.

## Collaboration and Innovation

- There's potential for repurposing oil and gas sector technologies for geothermal development.
- Milestone payments and prizes can incentivize intermediate technological progress.

The discussion emphasized the need for collaboration between the geothermal sector, investors, large corporate purchasers, and policymakers to fully leverage geothermal energy's potential

1](<Olaf Rheim, CEO of Exus since 2014, presented on the company's application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in drilling optimization, particularly focusing on its potential in geothermal drilling. Here's a summary of the key points:
Exus's AI-Driven Drilling Optimization

    Developed over 5-6 years, Exus's AI algorithms have been used in live operations across multiple continents1

.
The system includes drilling optimization and stuck pipe prediction, capable of generalizing across different fields and regions without additional training1
.
Continuous improvement has reduced false positive rates for stuck pipe prediction from 5% to nearly 0%1

    .

AI Application Process

    Real-time drilling data is collected and processed1

.
A rig activity recognition module tailors data for specific activities (e.g., tripping, drilling, reaming)1
.
About 25 separate machine learning models are used in the optimization product1
.
Results are simplified for rig personnel, providing actionable recommendations1

    .

Potential in Geothermal Drilling

    Lost circulation in geothermal drilling (7% of operations) presents a significant opportunity, potentially worth $280 million per year in five years1

.
The average cost of lost circulation per well is estimated at $350,0001
.
Exus believes their AI models can provide value to the geothermal drilling industry1

    .

Challenges and Adaptations

    Geothermal drilling in volcanic rocks differs from conventional oil and gas drilling1

.
Lost circulation in geothermal drilling is often caused by open faults, requiring adaptation of existing models1
.
Exus is training models for these specific rock types and scenarios1
.
Data acquisition in remote areas with low-cost rigs presents a challenge for implementing AI solutions1

    .

Market Considerations

    The oil and gas market ($67 billion per year) has greater financial resources compared to geothermal1

.
Exus believes that with minimal investment, they can tailor their models for geothermal drilling1

    .

This presentation highlights the potential for AI-driven optimization in geothermal drilling, while acknowledging the need for adaptations and addressing specific challenges in the field.>)
