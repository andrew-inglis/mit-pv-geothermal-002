From Perplexity:

The conversation is between two individuals discussing climate change, technology, and business innovation. Here are the key points:

1. Mike Shreer, former CTO of Facebook (now Meta), left the company in 2022 to focus on addressing climate change

- He approaches climate change through philanthropy and investing, supporting entrepreneurs who develop technologies that are both cost-effective and environmentally friendly
- Shreer's philanthropic efforts include funding research on carbon removal and investigating ways to slow glacier melting and sea level rise
- In terms of business, Shreer emphasizes the importance of timing and technological readiness. He notes that many climate-related business ideas that failed in the past are now viable due to technological advancements and market readiness
- The conversation highlights the potential of geothermal energy as a 24/7 power source, particularly for data centers and AI-related infrastructure
- Shreer sees the increasing power demand from AI and data centers as an opportunity to build cleaner energy assets and infrastructure
