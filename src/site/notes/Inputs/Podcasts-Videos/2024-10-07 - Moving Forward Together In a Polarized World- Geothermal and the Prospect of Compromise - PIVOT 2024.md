## Notes

From Perplexity:

This panel discussion focused on the bipartisan potential of geothermal energy in the United States. Key points include:

## Geothermal as a Unifying Energy Source

- Geothermal energy has largely avoided polarization and is naturally bipartisan.
- In Texas, geothermal legislation passed with near-unanimous support in both chambers.

## State-Level Perspectives

- Pennsylvania is exploring geothermal as part of its energy strategy, leveraging existing infrastructure and workforce from the oil and gas industry

    

- .
- The state has 300,000 abandoned oil and gas wells that could potentially be converted to geothermal resources.

## Federal and Military Interests

- The U.S. Air Force considers geothermal a national security imperative and its top energy innovation priority.
- The military is open to partnerships with geothermal companies for development on their land holdings.

## Business and Policy Considerations

- Corporate energy buyers have contracted over 84 GW of clean energy in the past decade without mandates.
- Tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act are seen as promoting capital formation and entrepreneurial risk in clean energy projects.

## Challenges and Opportunities

- Artificial Intelligence and data centers are driving increased energy demand, creating opportunities for clean energy solutions.
- Transmission and interconnection issues remain significant obstacles for innovative energy technologies.

The panel emphasized the importance of cross-partisan cooperation, education of policymakers, and leveraging existing infrastructure to advance geothermal energy development in the United States.
