## Notes

From Perplexity:

panel discussion about geothermal energy's potential, focusing on how oil and gas skills and technologies can help advance geothermal development. Here are the key highlights: **Current State of Geothermal**

- Currently represents only 0.2% of global power generation capacity
- Installed capacity is around 17 GW, with half located in the US, Philippines, and Indonesia
- Concentrated around the "Ring of Fire" geological region

**Potential and Growth**

- Geothermal offers 24/7 baseload renewable energy
- Experts predict significant growth potential, especially in:
    
    - Indonesia
    - United States (with Enhanced Geothermal Systems)
    - Kenya
    - European heating markets
    

**Key Advantages**

- Constant, non-weather dependent energy source
- Small land footprint
- High capacity factor (around 70%)
- Grid stability
- Potential for multiple applications (power, heating, lithium extraction)

**Challenges**

- Location restrictions
- High capital expenditure
- Subsurface exploration risks
- Permitting complexities
- Limited public awareness

**Oil and Gas Industry's Role**

- Transferable skills in drilling, exploration, and production
- Technology cross-pollination
- Potential to drill 10,000 geothermal wells annually
- Innovative approaches from drilling technologies

The panelists were optimistic about geothermal's future, emphasizing technological innovation and supportive policy as key drivers for growth.
