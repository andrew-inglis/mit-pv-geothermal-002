## Notes

Perplexity:
The excerpt discusses the potential for geothermal energy production in active oil and gas basins in the United States. Key points include:

## Geothermal Potential in Oil and Gas Basins

- Oil and gas wells are often drilled to depths of 1-2 miles in thermally mature basins.
- These basins have significant heat, which is necessary for hydrocarbon production.
- Bottom hole temperatures in some basins reach over 300°F (Haynesville) or 290°F (North Dakota).
- Many oil and gas companies view this heat as a nuisance or safety risk.

## Geothermal Energy Opportunities

- The high temperatures in these wells are suitable for power generation.
- There's potential to harness this heat for geothermal energy production.



## Geothermal Technologies and Deployments

Several innovative geothermal technologies and deployments are being developed and implemented, primarily focusing on harnessing heat from existing oil and gas infrastructure. Here's a review of the key technologies and deployments discussed:

## Gradient Geothermal's HXC System

- **Technology**: Modular, mobile geothermal units that generate power from waste heat in oil and gas wells[1](https://www.cleanpowerhour.com/geothermal-technology-is-cleaning-up-fossil-fuels-at-the-source-with-johanna-ostrum-ep254/)[5](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-gradient-geothermal-taps-into-the-geothermal-potential-of-oilfields/).
- **Deployment**:
    
    - First full-scale commercial deployment in North Dakota with Chord Energy[2](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2024/12/10/geothermal-energy-deployment-deal.html)[3](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gradient-to-generate-geothermal-power-in-north-dakota-oil-and-gas-facility/).
    - 75kW system generating power from waste heat removed while cooling oil and gas wells[2](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2024/12/10/geothermal-energy-deployment-deal.html).
    - Project partially funded by the Clean Sustainable Energy Authority (CSEA) of North Dakota[3](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/gradient-to-generate-geothermal-power-in-north-dakota-oil-and-gas-facility/).
    

## Geothermal Technologies' GenaSys™ System

- **Technology**: Subsurface energy harvesting system optimizing thermal recharge for long-term geothermal energy production[6](https://geothermal.tech).
- **Deployment**: GenaSys™-1 Project under construction in Pierce, Colorado[6](https://geothermal.tech).

## Oil and Gas Well Repurposing

- **Potential**: Approximately 500,000 wells across the United States could be repurposed for geothermal energy production7

- .
- **Technology**: Uses [[Evergreen/General Technology and Approaches/Organic Rankine Cycle\|Organic Rankine Cycle]] systems to capture waste heat from active and inactive wells7

- .

## Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)

- **Deployment**: Fervo Cape Geothermal Power Project in Beaver County, Utah, showcasing EGS technology[8](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/new-geothermal-podcast-geothermal-unleashed-with-elizabeth-cambre/).

## Key Innovations and Approaches

1. **Integration with Oil and Gas**: Many technologies focus on utilizing existing oil and gas infrastructure, reducing costs and leveraging industry expertise[5](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-gradient-geothermal-taps-into-the-geothermal-potential-of-oilfields/)7

- .
- **Modular and Mobile Systems**: Gradient Geothermal's approach allows for flexible deployment across various sites[2](https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2024/12/10/geothermal-energy-deployment-deal.html)[5](https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/interview-how-gradient-geothermal-taps-into-the-geothermal-potential-of-oilfields/).
- **Dual-Purpose Solutions**: Technologies like Gradient's HXC system provide both power generation and cooling services for oil and gas operations[4](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/12/4/gradient-chord-energy-launch-geothermal-project-for-williston-basin-oil-and-gas-assets/).
- **Sustainable Repurposing**: Focus on converting existing wells and infrastructure to geothermal energy production, extending the life of these assets7

1. .
2. **Advanced Drilling Techniques**: Geothermal companies are adopting horizontal drilling techniques from the oil and gas industry to improve efficiency[9](https://letscleartheairnow.org/podcast/episode-16-everything-you-need-to-know-about-geothermal-energy-with-gradient-geothermals-johanna-ostrum/).

These technologies and deployments represent a significant shift towards integrating geothermal energy with existing energy infrastructure, potentially accelerating the adoption of geothermal power and contributing to the clean energy transition.
