## Notes

From Perplexity:

This is a panel discussion about geothermal energy and decarbonization in emerging economies, specifically focusing on India. The key points discussed include: **Panel Overview**  


**India's Energy Challenges**  
India faces several critical decarbonization challenges:

- As the world's fastest-growing major economy, India cannot slow economic growth while transitioning to clean energy
- Currently, about 75% of power generation comes from fossil fuels
- Energy demand is growing rapidly (power demand at 12%, peak power demand at 14%)
- Needs to increase clean energy deployment from 15-16 GW to 50 GW annually

**Geothermal Energy Potential**  
The panelists see significant promise in geothermal energy:

- Could provide critical baseload power to complement intermittent renewables
- Particularly promising for industrial heat processes
- In the chemical industry, geothermal could potentially decarbonize up to 75% of processes at temperatures between 200-250Â°C
- Current challenges include lack of policy support and limited understanding of geothermal resources

**Key Insights**

- Clean energy investment in 2023 was heavily skewed towards advanced economies
- India needs a multi-technology approach to decarbonization
- Geothermal could play a catalytic role in nudging energy system planners away from coal

The conversation emphasizes the critical importance of finding clean energy solutions that do not compromise economic growth in emerging economies like India.
