## Notes
from Perplexity:

Here's a summary of the key points from the conversation between Elizabeth Cambry and Chris Fred about geothermal energy and technology:

## Background and Experience

- Chris Fred has 22 years of experience with Schlumberger, including 12 years working internationally in Russia and the Middle East.
    
- He gained expertise in various areas including hydraulic fracturing, production optimization, and new product development across different reservoir types.
    
- Chris is now involved with Blue Angel Energy, a technology accelerator helping advance innovation in the energy sector.
    

## Geothermal Projects and Technology

- Chris worked on the Utah FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy) project, focusing on advanced tracer interpretation.
    
- The project provided insights into what drives the performance of geothermal systems.
    
- Novel technologies were used, including a quantitative production log (QPL) and fracture circulation volume measurements.
    

## Key Findings and Implications

- The effective porosity in geothermal flow paths was found to be remarkably high (about 80%), much higher than conventional proppant packs.
    
- This finding suggests that the actual flow path in the subsurface is different from what current models predict, opening up new ways to optimize geothermal systems.
    
- The project integrated tracer interpretation with estimates of economic life for each stage, allowing for prediction of commercial impact of various design parameters.
    

## Future of Geothermal Energy

- There's potential to tailor fracturing solutions specifically for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), learning from but not necessarily copying techniques used in shale gas and oil.
    
- Multi-disciplinary collaboration is expected to lead to innovative solutions for next-generation geothermal systems.
    
- The lessons learned from EGS could potentially translate back to improvements in oil and gas extraction techniques.
    

## Challenges and Opportunities

- Balancing operational efficiency with long-term performance of EGS wells is a key challenge.
    
- There's a need to optimize proppant transport, hydraulic fracture conductivity, and well construction costs for the specific requirements of geothermal systems.
    
- The geothermal industry has the opportunity to develop tailored solutions that may differ significantly from current oil and gas practices.
