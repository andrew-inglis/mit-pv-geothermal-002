## Key Takeaways

- [[Evergreen/Organizations/International Geothermal Association (IGA)\|International Geothermal Association (IGA)]] is an international organization that supports the development of geothermal globally
- Great quote about leveraging resources near hotspots for new projects (that I want to mention to [[Evergreen/People/Adam Francis\|Adam Francis]])
- Difference in business models of oil and gas and geothermal
	- Another difference connected with the tech advance one mentioned by [[Evergreen/People/Torsten Kolind\|Torsten Kolind]] in [[Inputs/Podcasts-Videos/2024-11-26 Breaking New Ground- Investing in the Future of Super-Hoe Rock - Geothermal Unleashed Podcast\|2024-11-26 Breaking New Ground- Investing in the Future of Super-Hoe Rock - Geothermal Unleashed Podcast]]

## Notes

“Second, you're asking about oil and gas. I mean, it is super interesting to me and I guess we can have this conversation over and over again every year because things are changing of course from year to year because an oil and gas company, in my opinion, an oil and gas company is a commodity driven business model and it's delivering, from an operator point of view, I'm speaking, and it's delivering, let's say, energy business towards the shareholder who wants either to get a return on his or her investment immediately, as in every year, maybe every quarter, or it gets dividends out of that investment. So it's a shareholder arrangement with a short eye on the bottom line of a specific energy company, which is commodity based.

That is a fundamental different business model than geothermal. Geothermal is long term, it's patient capital, you will get your cash back, but probably not in the first three to five years.

Do we have shareholders?

The majority of geothermal companies, there are some exceptions, obviously, but the majority of geothermal companies are a combination between private and public. It's a public service that geothermal companies are delivering either to[…]”

“If I look at the areas where I would see a superb potential, are both, let's say, the Caribbean and Central American countries, and of course, Latin America maybe as a whole, where you see that some of it has been tapped because we have power plants in Central America and there is one or two demonstration sites in the Caribbean. But if you really look to lift those folks out of poverty or to slash electricity bills on those remote islands or poor remote communities, it's so logical to go into geothermal. Now, why is that not happening?

That is a combination between not having the right policies, not understanding the resource, again, education, and hence educating also the regulators and the authority bodies on geothermal. And that goes also a little bit to the other side of the ocean, where you see, for instance, a phenomenal impact we could create in the Pacific Islands, right? Vanuatu, Fiji, the Solomon Islands.

I mean, these folks pay an enormous amount of money per kilowatt hour. And that's something like 65 to 90 cents is not a joke. US dollar cents, right, for kilowatt hour.

Now, I pay here in the Netherlands, 40. Iceland only pays 18 cents. I don't know what your bill is by the end of the month, but let us have a look at that and understand that those, let's say, the poorest pay the most, which is not good in my SDG type of Bible.

SDG studies for the sustainable development goals. And that's an important sort of lever for us to all contribute towards, you know, fair and a just transition, but also a sustainable transition.”
