## Notes

From Perplexity:
Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems, presented an innovative approach to energy storage and geothermal energy production. Here are the key points from her presentation:

## Energy Storage Technology

Sage Geosystems has developed a mechanical energy storage system that operates similarly to pumped hydro storage but deep within the Earth. The process involves:

1. Drilling a well 7,000-12,000 feet deep
2. Creating a fracture in a low-permeability formation
3. Pumping water into the fracture during low electricity demand periods
4. Releasing the pressurized water through a Pelton turbine to generate electricity during peak demand

This technology demonstrated impressive results during a full-scale commercial pilot:

- 200 kilowatts for 18 hours
- 450 kilowatts for 6 hours
- 650 kilowatts for 2 hours
- 1 megawatt for 30 minutes (limited by surface piping)

The system achieved a subsurface efficiency of 88-94% and an estimated overall system efficiency of 70%

## Advantages and Applications

**Key benefits of Sage's technology include:**

- Geographical flexibility (not limited to specific locations)
- Ability to turn intermittent renewable sources into baseload power
- Load-following capabilities for peak demand periods
- Potential for heat utilization in industrial processes

The company aims to build its first energy storage power plant by mid-2024, with an estimated output of 2-3 megawatts net per well

## Geothermal Applications

While primarily focused on energy storage, Sage sees itself as both a storage and geothermal company. The storage technology demonstrates about 80% of the technologies needed for geothermal energy production. For geothermal applications, Sage targets depths of around 21,000 feet to reach temperatures of 150Â°C or higher

## Economic Viability

Sage claims that their technology is cost-competitive with pumped hydro storage and lithium-ion batteries in terms of upfront capital costs and levelized cost of storage (LCOS). They expect to become even more cost-effective as the technology scales up

## Future Outlook

In the next two years, Sage plans to prove their energy storage technology in a power plant setting and leverage that experience to build a geothermal power plant. The company has attracted interest from partners and investors, positioning them for potential rapid scaling once they start delivering electricity from their first-of-a-kind plant
