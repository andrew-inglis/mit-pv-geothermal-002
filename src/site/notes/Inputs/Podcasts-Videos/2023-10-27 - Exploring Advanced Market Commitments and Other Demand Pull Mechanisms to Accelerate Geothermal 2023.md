## Notes

From Perplexity:

This panel discussion focused on market shaping and the future of geothermal energy, featuring experts from academia, industry, and policy. Here are the key points:

## Market Shaping

- Market shaping leverages private sector and market incentives to deliver innovations society needs, recognizing that markets may not have the right incentives without intervention.
- It aims to bridge the gap between social value and private returns for innovations.
- Examples include advanced market commitments for vaccines and cap-and-trade markets for carbon emissions.

## Geothermal Energy's Importance

- Google sees geothermal as crucial for achieving its 24/7 carbon-free energy goal, as it provides firm, clean power around the clock.
- Geothermal complements other renewable sources like wind and solar in a portfolio approach to clean energy.

## Demand Aggregation and Corporate Involvement

- Demand aggregation from multiple companies can help address the "valley of death" for first-of-a-kind projects.
- Corporate buyers can provide crucial demand signals and off-take agreements to help finance new projects.

## Policy and Government Role

- Government can support geothermal through technology-neutral policies, permitting reform, and valuing 24/7 clean power.
- Both federal and state governments can play important roles in incentivizing and unlocking geothermal potential.

## Collaboration and Innovation

- There's potential for repurposing oil and gas sector technologies for geothermal development.
- Milestone payments and prizes can incentivize intermediate technological progress.

The discussion emphasized the need for collaboration between the geothermal sector, investors, large corporate purchasers, and policymakers to fully leverage geothermal energy's potential
