## Notes

from Perplexity:

This transcript discusses the potential of super hot rock geothermal energy and the key innovations needed for its development. Here are the main points:

## Key Innovations and Challenges

- **Hybrid Approach**: Combining existing oil and gas industry assets with new technologies for deep geothermal drilling
    
- .
- **Thermal Drilling**: Using hot streams to stress and crumble rock, potentially faster than mechanical drilling

- .
- **Well Design**: Focusing on mechanical durability, proper analysis, and planning for cyclic thermal stresses
    
- .
- **Reservoir Creation**: Considered one of the most significant challenges, including fracture initiation and zonal isolation at great depths
    
- .
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Developing fracture diagnostic and logging tools capable of withstanding super hot temperatures
    

## Opportunities and Costs

- **Potential Locations**: Magmatic areas are considered low-hanging fruit for super hot rock projects, with existing wells at Newberry Volcano as potential test sites
    
   
- .
- **Cost Competitiveness**: Estimated levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for super hot rock projects could be as low as $31 per megawatt-hour, making it competitive with solar and wind
    

- **Well Costs**: Estimated at $20-30 million per well, with casing materials being a significant factor
