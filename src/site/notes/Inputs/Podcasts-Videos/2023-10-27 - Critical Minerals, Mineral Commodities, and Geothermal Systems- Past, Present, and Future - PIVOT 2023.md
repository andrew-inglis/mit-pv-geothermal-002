## Notes

From Perplexity:

This panel discussion focused on the intersection of geothermal systems and critical minerals, exploring various aspects of their development and potential. Key points from the discussion include:

## Geothermal Development and Critical Minerals

- The geothermal industry faces challenges in scaling up, with only 11 production rigs operating in the United States compared to thousands in the oil and gas sector.
- There's a need for policy changes to encourage more geothermal exploration and development, including streamlining permitting processes and providing incentives.
- Critical minerals extraction from geothermal brines, particularly lithium, is gaining attention, but technological and economic challenges remain.

## Beyond Lithium

- While lithium has been a focus, other critical minerals present in geothermal fluids include rare earth elements, thorium, germanium, gallium, and selenium.
- Extracting these minerals could provide additional value to geothermal projects, but economic viability needs to be carefully assessed.

## Data Collection and Research

- There's a need for more comprehensive databases of geothermal fluid compositions and improved understanding of fluid-rock interactions.
- Advanced geophysical techniques used in mineral exploration could potentially be applied to geothermal exploration, especially for blind systems.

## Collaboration and Education

- Panelists emphasized the importance of collaboration between the geothermal and mineral industries, as well as between government agencies and private sector.
- There's a need for more earth science education and recruitment to ensure a skilled workforce for future geothermal and mineral exploration.

## Policy and Funding

- Consistent long-term energy policies are crucial for sustained industry growth.
- Recent legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act provides a 10-year window of support, which could catalyze investment in geothermal energy.

The panel concluded by highlighting the need for increased drilling activity, improved permitting processes, better understanding of geothermal systems, and greater collaboration across industries and disciplines to advance both geothermal energy and critical mineral extraction
