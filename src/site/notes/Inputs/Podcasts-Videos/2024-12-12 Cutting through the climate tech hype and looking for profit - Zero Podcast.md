## Summary of the Podcast Interview with Eric Tun from [[Evergreen/Organizations/Investors-Funders/Private/Breakthrough Energy Ventures\|Breakthrough Energy Ventures]] 

The podcast, featuring Eric Tun, a former chemistry professor now working with Breakthrough Energy Ventures, explores several key climate technologies and their potential for addressing global energy challenges:

## Carbon Removal

- Currently has around 800 startups
- Needs smarter investment strategies
- Two potential markets:
    
    1. Carbon sequestration
    2. Carbon as a reagent for zero-carbon materials
    

## Grid Technologies

Two key areas of interest:

1. Reconductoring existing roadways to carry more power
2. Advanced grid operation and modeling, which is currently underhyped

## Nuclear Technologies

## Nuclear Fission

- Potential for new, safer reactor designs
- Need to rebuild nuclear construction expertise
- Competitive target: $130/megawatt hour (compared to coal at $100)

## Nuclear Fusion

- Recent technological advances in superconducting materials
- Potentially safer than fission
- Attracting increased investor interest

## Hydrogen

- Promising developments in:
    
    1. Cheap electricity enabling cheaper electrolysis
    2. Discovery of natural hydrogen sources
    
- Challenges remain in transportation and storage infrastructure

The overall theme emphasizes the need for practical, cost-effective solutions to decarbonize energy systems globally.


Eric Tun makes several key points about geothermal energy:

1. Historically, geothermal energy required three things: heat, permeability, and water. This limited its availability to specific locations like Iceland and parts of the Western United States.
2. New technologies, like those developed by Fervo (one of their portfolio companies), have overcome limitations related to permeability and water availability. These advances take advantage of drilling technologies from the oil and gas industry.
3. With these new technologies, there are "tremendous opportunities to expand geothermal" energy production.
4. Tun believes that geothermal energy can now be "very widely distributed" due to these technological advancements.
5. He states that "there's nothing inherent that limits the scalability of geothermal."
6. Tun sees geothermal as a promising area for new technology development and learning.

Overall, Eric Tun appears optimistic about the potential for geothermal energy to play a larger role in clean, dispatchable electricity generation, thanks to recent technological innovations.


Based on Eric Tun's comments, the most challenging aspect of investing in climate tech is:

1. The difficulty in scaling technologies compared to other tech sectors. As Eric states: "things in this space don't scale the way that apps or computers scale - this is steel in the ground stuff."
2. The long timelines and large capital requirements. He notes that after 7-10 years and $300-400 million invested to get a technology ready to scale, you then need to "raise a billion dollars to do a first-of-a-kind plant."
3. The thin margins and commodity nature of the products. Eric emphasizes that "electrons are the most undifferentiated commodities on the face of the Earth" and industries have "razor thin" margins.
4. Existing entrenched interests in the energy sector that are "enormous."
5. The market reaction, which is focused solely on cost rather than innovation. As he puts it, the reaction is not "oh that's unbelievably cool" but rather "we'll see if you can make it 5% cheaper than the way we make it now."

Eric summarizes that while he knew these challenges intellectually before, being "in the middle of it and to really feel it viscerally" has changed his perspective on the difficulties of climate tech investing.
