## Notes

From Perplexity:

The panel discussion focused on financing challenges for Next Generation geothermal technologies, with key insights from experts in energy investment and policy:

## Financing Challenges in Geothermal Energy

**Key Barriers to Investment**

- High upfront capital expenditure for drilling and equipment
- Binary risk in project development
- Long payback periods (potentially up to a decade)
- Lack of proven track record for innovative technologies
    

## Perspectives from Panelists

**Investment Landscape**

- Geothermal is at an early stage, similar to solar's early days
- Requires creative financing mechanisms to bridge the funding gap
- Potential for significant market opportunity, with an estimated $3 trillion annual market through 2050

    

**Potential Solutions**

- Catalytic risk insurance
- Government support and R&D funding
- Rapid iteration of new concepts
- Attracting infrastructure and project finance equity
- Identifying sophisticated electricity buyers
    

## Path Forward

**Critical Needs**

- Demonstrate good unit economics
- Reduce technology and infrastructure risks
- Create innovative financing models
- Develop insurance products to backstop investments

The panelists were optimistic about geothermal's potential, comparing its current stage to solar's early development and seeing it as a critical technology for decarbonizing the electricity sector.
