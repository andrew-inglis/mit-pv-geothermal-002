## Notes

This panel discussion, part of Pivot 2021, focused on innovative drilling technologies for deep geothermal energy. Four companies presented their novel approaches to drilling:

1. Quaise: Developing millimeter wave drilling systems for basement rock, aiming to reach depths of 20 kilometers and temperatures of 500°C. Their technology uses gyrotrons to beam energy through conventional oil pipes.
2. GA Drilling: Creating a plasma drilling tool that uses thermal stressing to destroy rock, designed for high-pressure, high-temperature environments.
3. Hyper Sciences: Utilizing hypersonic projectiles fired in front of a rotating bit to pulverize rock, allowing for faster drilling in hard, deep, and high-temperature formations.
4. Orchid Project: Combining high-pressure water jetting and percussion drilling to increase the rate of penetration in hard rocks by at least three times.

Key points discussed:

- All technologies aim to make geothermal energy more accessible and economical by enabling deeper and faster drilling in hard rock formations.
- The panelists emphasized the need for ambitious goals in geothermal energy, targeting terawatt-scale production.
- Funding sources varied, including venture capital, grants, and industry partnerships.
- Most technologies are still in development or early testing phases, with commercialization expected in the next 3-5 years.
- The panelists highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and collaboration between academia and industry to advance these technologies.

The discussion underscored the potential for these innovative drilling technologies to revolutionize geothermal energy production and contribute significantly to the clean energy transition.
