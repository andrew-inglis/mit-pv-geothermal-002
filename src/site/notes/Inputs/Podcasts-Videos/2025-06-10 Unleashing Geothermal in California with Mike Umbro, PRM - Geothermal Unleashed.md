## Main Points of the "Geothermal Unleashed" Podcast Episode

**Overview and Guests**

- Host: Elizabeth Camry (Valer New Energies)
    
- Guest: Mike Umbro, co-founder of Premier Resource Management and founder/CEO of Californians for Energy and Science, a nonprofit focused on energy, environment, and economics education.
    

**Mike Umbro’s Background and Project Focus**

- Mike Umbro is a California native with a finance background who transitioned into energy development, focusing on lowering energy costs and providing reliable, clean power in California.
    
- Premier Resource Management began as an oil project in Kern County but pivoted to geothermal and geologic thermal energy storage (GeoEST) in response to state policies discouraging new oil and gas projects.
    

**Innovative Geothermal Project**

- The project involves converting old oil reservoirs into synthetic geothermal resources by:
    
    - Using concentrated solar troughs to heat a working fluid.
        
    - Extracting oil as a byproduct, then using the remaining brackish water for heat storage.
        
    - Creating a closed-loop system to dispatch hot water for steam turbine power generation, producing demand-aligned, dispatchable geothermal power.
        
- The oil reservoir acts as a container to trap and store thermal energy, enabling long-lived clean power generation (potentially 70–100 years).
    

**Challenges in California’s Regulatory Environment**

- California’s strict policies have made it extremely difficult to obtain permits for oil, gas, and geothermal projects.
    
    - Drilling permits have dropped dramatically (from ~3,000 annually to just 28).
        
    - Permitting for underground injection control (UIC) can take a decade.
        
    - Wellbore stimulation treatments (needed for enhanced geothermal systems) are essentially outlawed, with only limited carveouts for geothermal.
        
- The disconnect between state policy goals (more clean power) and permitting realities is a major barrier to innovation and project development.
    

**Federal and Industry Support**

- The project has received a $6 million grant from the Department of Energy and partnerships with national labs (NREL, Lawrence Berkeley, Idaho National Lab).
    
- Support is bipartisan, appealing to both traditional oil and gas workers (by providing new job opportunities) and clean energy advocates.
    

**California’s Energy Crisis and Call to Action**

- California faces multiple energy crises: highest gasoline and utility prices in the U.S., refinery closures, and heavy reliance on imported oil and electricity.
    
- The state imports 60%+ of its crude oil and 30% of its electricity, making local energy production essential for affordability, reliability, and environmental benefits.
    
- The call to action is for policymakers to recognize the importance of local energy production and to streamline permitting to unleash California’s energy potential.
    

**Community Engagement and Nonprofit Work**

- Californians for Energy and Science focuses on educating students and the public about energy realities and opportunities.
    
- The nonprofit holds events at high schools and universities to foster open discussion and awareness of the energy sector’s importance for jobs and economic vibrancy.
    

**Industry Sentiment and Future Outlook**

- There is a growing acceptance within both the oil/gas and geothermal communities for hybrid projects like GeoEST.
    
- The project demonstrates that hydrocarbons can fund the upfront costs of clean energy infrastructure, making the transition both economically and environmentally viable.
    
- The podcast emphasizes the need for optimism, innovation, and active engagement to solve California’s energy challenges and unleash geothermal’s full potential.
    

**Upcoming Events and Advocacy**

- Mike Umbro and Elizabeth Camry are participating in the California Energy Innovation Openhouse and Capitol Hill advocacy for geothermal energy.
    
- The focus is on sharing solutions, building consensus, and influencing policymakers to support energy innovation and reform permitting processes.
    

**Final Message**

- The episode closes with encouragement for listeners to get involved in geothermal energy and help drive the industry forward, highlighting the sector’s potential and the importance of collaborative action.
