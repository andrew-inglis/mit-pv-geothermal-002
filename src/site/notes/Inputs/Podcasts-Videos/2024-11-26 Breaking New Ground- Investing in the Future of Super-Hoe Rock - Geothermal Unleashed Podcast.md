## Notes

“So when we look at technologies for that future, we're really looking for what are the products and technologies that can de-risk this for everybody else. We're not necessarily looking at the ones that do it all themselves, the sort of vertically integrated one power plant after another, but much more so those that can be part of a global toolbox. Let's put it that way and say that these are the bits and pieces people choose from when they decide we're going to do a new geothermal power plant, 100 megawatt geothermal power plant in Indonesia.

Well, what do we need for drilling? What do we need for well case? What turbines do we need?

All of that stuff, we're hoping to invest into those companies that can allow everybody else to succeed with their ventures. That's just essentially a choice, a strategy. We believe we'll have higher impact that way.

But obviously, the alternative would be to invest in vertically integrated companies. So it's just a choice that so far I feel really good about.”

“So obviously, I've seen you all around the geothermal space and touching into the oil and gas space. But are there other spaces that you are scouting for technology that might have application here?

Yeah. So, you know, we have been going to the same events. Clearly, it is still not a huge space.

So that has been, I think, fairly uncomplicated for me to get into meeting a bunch of the people already in the space. That is really useful for scouting, but also for validation, you know, because I can source a lot of opinions about somebody's new technology. And I should say, it's very common that I get negative opinions.

You know, somebody, it's much easier for somebody to tell me why something is not going to work than it is to explain why it would work. And so you always have to handle to what level are you okay with negative opinions. They're really, really useful, because there's a reason behind it.

So just letting you know, yes, it's good for scouting. Yes, it's good for validation. But I think the more you're looking to solve problems that the industry has not solved yet, the more[…]”

“And it's so interesting. I find that whenever I hear about new, radically different approaches in this industry, new products and technologies, almost every time there's something that's really, really new, it's a non-oil and gas person who has invented it. And that doesn't mean we don't need that whole side of the experience to develop it.

But it's just, it's interesting how much that locks people into the constraints of what oil and gas knowledge and equipment is able to do. So it's a double-edged sword. It's incredibly valuable to have that experience, but you have to be very aware of not falling into the trap that your thermal can do nothing differently than oil and gas.”

From Perplexity:

The transcript provided is from a podcast episode discussing advancements and investment opportunities in geothermal energy, with a focus on **super hot rock geothermal**. Below is a summary of the key points:

## **What is Super Hot Rock Geothermal?**

- Traditional geothermal energy operates at temperatures of up to 180–200°C, while super hot rock geothermal aims to reach 300–450°C.
- Higher temperatures improve energy extraction and electricity conversion efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale utility projects.

## **Investment Landscape**

- **Underground Ventures**, represented by Torsten, is one of the first venture capital firms specializing in geothermal technology, particularly super hot rock.
- The firm focuses on technologies that can scale globally and reduce risks for other developers, rather than vertically integrated projects.
- They have invested in companies like:
    
    - [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal Integration drilling/GA Drilling\|GA Drilling]]: Specializing in plasma drilling and stabilization tools.
    - [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal Integration drilling/Canopus drilling\|Canopus drilling]]: Developing particle-assisted drilling technology.
    - A third unannounced company working on high-temperature downhole tools.
	    - This is [[Evergreen/Companies/Horizontal Integration drilling/Hephae Energy Technology\|Hephae Energy Technology]]
    

## **Challenges and Opportunities**

- Geothermal energy currently contributes about 0.3% of global electricity but has the potential to reach 10%, equivalent to thousands of power plants and tens of thousands of wells.
- Super hot rock geothermal faces technological gaps, particularly in [[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/drilling tools\|drilling tools]], [[well completions\|well completions]], and [[operating at extreme temperatures and pressures\|operating at extreme temperatures and pressures]].
- Innovations like millimeter-wave drilling (e.g., [[Evergreen/Companies/Vertical Integration/Quaise Energy\|Quaise Energy]]) and non-mechanical methods are critical for accessing deeper, hotter resources.

## **Geographical Potential**

- In the U.S., the best locations are on the West Coast and western half of the country due to favorable geology. Internationally, areas like Iceland, Northern Italy, Kenya, Indonesia, and Japan are promising due to existing geothermal activity.

## **Comparison of Power Output**

- Conventional geothermal wells typically produce a few megawatts per well.
- Super hot rock wells could achieve 15–30 megawatts per well due to higher energy density and efficiency.

## **Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)**

- Super hot rock geothermal is expected to significantly reduce LCOE compared to conventional methods. The U.S. Department of Energy targets $45 per megawatt-hour for geothermal energy in general.

## **Cross-Sector Learning**

- Lessons from oil and gas (e.g., drilling expertise) are valuable but may limit innovation due to entrenched practices.
- The [[nuclear industry offers insights into high-temperature operations\|nuclear industry offers insights into high-temperature operations]], [[Evergreen/Challenges-Needs-Gaps in Geothermal/Corrosion resistance\|Corrosion resistance]], and [[modularization\|modularization]]—concepts that could benefit geothermal development.

## **Advice for Startups**

- Focus on investors aligned with your technology and stage of development. Avoid wasting time on investors unlikely to fund your project.
- Be prepared for venture capitalists’ tendency to delay decisions or request additional work without clear commitments.

Super hot rock geothermal represents a transformative opportunity in renewable energy, with significant potential for scaling globally. However, it requires overcoming technical challenges and fostering innovation across multiple industries.
