## Notes
from Perplexity:

## **Philip Ball's Career Background**

- Philip has a PhD in geology, focusing on continental rift processes.
    
- He transitioned from academia to the oil and gas industry, spending 18 years in exploration and R&D roles with companies like Statoil (now Equinor), ConocoPhillips, and TotalEnergies.
    
- His expertise lies in heat flow modeling and understanding geological structures to predict oil and gas reserves.
    

## **Transition to Geothermal Energy**

- Philip became interested in geothermal energy during a 2018 conference in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He realized that his skills in heat flow mapping from oil and gas exploration could be applied to geothermal energy.
    
- He emphasized the ubiquity of heat as a resource and the potential for geothermal energy to play a significant role in the global energy transition.
    

## **Super Hot Rock and Global Mapping**

- Philip worked on mapping global geothermal resources using advanced models like LITH (a lithosphere reference model).
    
- His team created global maps predicting heat flow and identifying areas suitable for geothermal power plants (50 MW, 100 MW, or 250 MW).
    
- These maps highlight regions with shallow super hot rock potential, emphasizing geodynamic factors influencing heat distribution.
    

## **Geothermal Radar**

- Philip collaborates with Geothermal Radar, a startup that integrates geoscience data with techno-economic modeling for geothermal exploration.
    
- The platform combines surface-to-lithosphere thermal models with machine learning to predict subsurface temperatures and gradients globally.
    
- It is used by governments, universities, nonprofits, and startups to reduce uncertainty in geothermal exploration.
    

## **Geothermal Resource Management**

- Inspired by oil and gas methodologies, Philip advocates for a "Geothermal Resource Management System" (GRMS) to define resources probabilistically rather than deterministically.
    
- This approach aims to improve project planning by integrating resource characterization with economic modeling.
    

## **Synergies with Critical Minerals**

- Philip touched on the potential overlap between geothermal energy and critical minerals (e.g., lithium). Understanding tectonic processes could help locate mineral-rich zones alongside geothermal resources.
    

## **Future Directions**

- The discussion highlighted the need for better understanding of geological variability within provinces like the Basin and Range in the U.S.
    
- Philip emphasized collaboration between academia, industry, and governments to advance geothermal technologies and exploration techniques.
    

## **Conclusion**

The episode underscores the transformative potential of geothermal energy as part of the global energy transition. Philip Ball's expertise bridges oil and gas exploration techniques with cutting-edge geothermal research, offering innovative solutions to harness Earth's heat efficiently.
