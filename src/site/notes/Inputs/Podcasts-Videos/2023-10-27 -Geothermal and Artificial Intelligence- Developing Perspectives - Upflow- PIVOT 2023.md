## Notes

From Perplexity:

Dr. Hercules Constantopoulos, a chief data scientist from Upflow, presented on the application of AI in optimizing geothermal energy production. Here are the key points:

## AI in Geothermal Energy

**Potential Impact:**

- A 2% boost in installed geothermal capacity in the US (3.7 GW) could yield 75 MW of additional power

- This increase is equivalent to about 7% of California's mandate for 1000 MW of new zero-emission baseload power
    
 
- The financial impact is significant, potentially saving around $250 million in drilling costs
 
**GOL Project:**

- GOL (Geothermal Operational Optimization with Machine Learning) is a workbench for geothermal field optimization
    

- It creates digital twins of steam fields to suggest optimization strategies to operators
    
 
- The project was funded by the US Department of Energy and developed in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Lab and commercial partners



**AI Techniques Used:**

- Reinforcement Learning: An agent makes small changes to the steam field and observes the effects, learning to optimize over time
    

- Genetic Optimization: Treats changes to the system as "mutations" and tests their survival based on performance
    


**Benefits:**

- Helps operators overcome limitations of current tools like Excel spreadsheets

- Allows for exploration of complex parameter spaces that human operators cannot easily navigate
    

- Maintains respect for real-world physics and thermodynamics in its models


**Future Prospects:**

- Potential for AI to move beyond optimization to actual steam field design
    

- Possibility of increased automation in non-risky areas of energy production


The presentation emphasized the exciting potential of AI in the energy sector, particularly in making geothermal energy more efficient and cost-effective
