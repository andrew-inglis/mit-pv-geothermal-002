## Notes

From Perplexity:

The panel discussion focused on the intersection of AI and geothermal energy development, highlighting several key points:

## Data and AI in Geothermal

- Data from the oil and gas industry can be leveraged to accelerate geothermal development, but geothermal-specific data is crucial for validation.
- Clean, curated data is essential for effective AI models. The panelists emphasized the importance of data standards and accessibility.
- AI can help analyze time-based data to detect anomalies and predict issues in geothermal systems.

## Applications and Benefits

- AI can optimize existing facilities, potentially increasing efficiency and profitability.
- Natural language processing can help in analyzing large volumes of reports and documents, saving time for geologists and other professionals.
- AI models can assist in reducing drilling costs for geothermal wells.

## Challenges and Considerations

- Each geothermal field is unique, limiting the transferability of models between sites.
- There's a need for partnerships between AI developers and geothermal operators to access expertise and real-world data.
- The geothermal industry needs to adapt to shorter lifecycles of digital infrastructure compared to physical facilities.

## Future Directions

- The panelists recommended resources like the Stanford Geothermal Workshop archives for those interested in the intersection of AI and geothermal energy.
- They stressed the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in this rapidly evolving field.

The discussion highlighted the potential of AI in geothermal energy while emphasizing the need for industry-specific data, expertise, and collaboration to fully realize its benefits
