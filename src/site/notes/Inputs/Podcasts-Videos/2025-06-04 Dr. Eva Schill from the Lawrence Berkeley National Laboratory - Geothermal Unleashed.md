## Main Points of the Podcast: "Geothermal Unleashed" with Dr. Eva Schill

**Host & Guest Introduction**

- Host: Elizabeth Camry from Valer New Energies.
    
- Guest: Dr. Eva Schill, Geothermal Systems Program Lead at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).
    
- Focus: Dr. Schill’s career, the importance of geothermal energy, advancements in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), and the role of AI in geothermal exploration.
    

**Dr. Schill’s Career Path**

- Background in geology and geophysics, with a PhD on the tectonic evolution of the Himalayas, which introduced her to geothermal energy through hot springs.
    
- First junior professor for geothermal energy in Germany and later in Switzerland.
    
- Led the Geoenergy Division at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, developing research infrastructure and geothermal labs.
    
- Joined LBNL less than a year ago, attracted by the scale and collaborative nature of U.S. geothermal projects.
    

**Geothermal Energy’s Strategic Role in the U.S.**

- Recent breakthroughs in EGS allow for the creation of geothermal reservoirs, making geothermal energy deployable almost anywhere in the U.S., not just in regions with natural permeability.
    
- The U.S. has significant geothermal potential (estimated at 5,500 GW electric) that is becoming increasingly achievable.
    
- Geothermal energy provides strategic benefits: electricity, heat, access to critical minerals (e.g., lithium extraction from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea), and synergy with oil and gas industries, leveraging existing infrastructure and skilled labor.
    

**Conventional vs. Enhanced Geothermal Systems**

|Feature|Conventional Geothermal|Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)|
|---|---|---|
|Resource Type|Naturally occurring hot water/steam reservoirs|Artificially created/improved reservoirs|
|Geographic Limitation|Restricted to tectonically active areas|Potentially deployable nationwide|
|Key Technology|Utilizes existing permeability|Actively creates/enhances fracture networks|
|Example Locations|Geysers (CA), Salton Sea|Utah FORGE, EGS Collab|

- EGS involves engineering the subsurface to create or improve fracture networks, enabling heat extraction from otherwise impermeable rock.
    

**LBNL’s Focus on EGS**

- EGS is seen as the most disruptive advancement in geoenergy since unconventional hydrocarbon production.
    
- LBNL brings over 40 years of experience in monitoring induced seismicity, which is used as a tool to image and manage reservoir development, not just as a risk factor.
    
- The lab is also pioneering measurement of asismic (non-seismic) deformation, crucial for understanding long-term reservoir integrity.
    

**Key Projects and Technologies**

- **The Geysers, California:** LBNL helped reopen and adapt abandoned wells for EGS at extreme temperatures (up to 750°F). Modeling showed that induced seismicity is mainly due to shear reactivation of existing fractures, triggered by thermal cooling and pressure changes.
    
- **Geoscience Measurement Facility (GMF):** Develops custom instrumentation (e.g., fiber optic sensing, GPS) for precise measurement of seismic and asismic deformation, enabling better management of induced seismicity and fracture monitoring.
    
- **Utah FORGE:** Deployment of advanced monitoring tools (distributed acoustic sensing, permanent seismic sources) to track fracture evolution and fluid pathways, aiming to optimize heat extraction and reduce risks like thermal breakthrough.
    
- **EGS Collab:** A multi-lab project at the SURF mine in South Dakota, preparing for Utah FORGE. Demonstrated successful hydraulic fracturing in crystalline basement rock, highlighting differences from oil and gas fracturing (e.g., deeper, hotter, more brittle rocks).
    

**Role of AI in Geothermal Exploration**

- AI and machine learning are being applied to large, complex seismic data sets to improve imaging of fracture networks and optimize resource development.
    
- Example: Sanskar Energy uses AI to identify hidden geothermal prospects and optimize development.
    
- LBNL uses AI to enhance seismic data interpretation and is exploring further applications as data volumes grow.
    

**Conclusion**

- EGS and related technologies are making geothermal energy scalable and more widely deployable.
    
- LBNL is at the forefront of both scientific research and technology development, with a strong emphasis on collaboration, innovation, and leveraging AI.
    
- Geothermal energy offers the U.S. a reliable, flexible, and strategic energy source, with opportunities for synergy with existing industries and critical mineral extraction.
