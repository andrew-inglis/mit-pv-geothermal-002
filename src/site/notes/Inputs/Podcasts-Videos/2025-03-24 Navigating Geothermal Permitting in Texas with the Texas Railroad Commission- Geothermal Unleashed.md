## **Overview**

The transcript is an interview with Jared Wear, a senior engineer and systems analyst at the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC), discussing the history, regulatory framework, and recent developments in geothermal energy permitting in Texas. The conversation highlights Texas' growing interest in geothermal energy as part of the broader global energy transition.

## **Key Points**

## **1. History of Geothermal Permitting in Texas**

- Geothermal permitting in Texas has been sporadic since the 1970s, with limited activity until recently.
    
- The first deep geothermal well was permitted in 1978. Since then, most activity has focused on shallow wells (e.g., ground-source heat pumps), with approximately 3,300 shallow wells permitted over the last 40 years.
    
- Recent legislative changes (e.g., Senate Bill 786) have consolidated permitting authority for closed-loop geothermal wells under the RRC.
    

## **2. Recent Developments**

- In February 2025, Sage Geosystems received a permit for a deep geothermal project, marking a significant milestone and signaling renewed interest in geothermal energy.
    
- The RRC has developed new guidelines and frameworks to streamline the permitting process for both shallow and deep geothermal wells.
    

## **3. Regulatory Framework**

- Historically, the RRC regulated deep geothermal wells, while the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) oversaw shallow wells. Recent legislation shifted all closed-loop geothermal permitting to the RRC.
    
- The RRC is working on new rules for deep geothermal wells, expected to be finalized by late summer or early fall of 2025.
    
- Permitting timelines at the RRC are relatively quick (typically under 45 days), though projects may require additional permits from other agencies (e.g., Public Utility Commission, groundwater districts).
    

## **4. Industry Trends**

- Interest in geothermal energy is growing rapidly, with several startups exploring projects in Texas.
    
- Military installations are emerging as key sites for geothermal projects due to their focus on energy resilience (e.g., projects at Joint Base San Antonio and Fort Bliss).
    
- The RRC is actively engaging with stakeholders through webinars, conferences, and collaboration with trade associations like the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance.
    

## **5. Challenges and Opportunities**

- Educating companies unfamiliar with Texas' regulatory processes is a priority.
    
- The RRC aims to streamline permitting while maintaining robust regulatory oversight.
    
- Collaboration with other states and agencies helps refine best practices for geothermal regulation.
    

## **6. Future Outlook**

- Texas is positioning itself as a leader in geothermal energy development, leveraging its business-friendly environment and extensive expertise in subsurface resource management.
    
- The RRC anticipates continued growth in geothermal projects as more companies enter the market and technological innovations expand possibilities.
    

## **Conclusion**

The interview underscores Texas' commitment to fostering geothermal energy development through regulatory reforms, stakeholder engagement, and support for innovative projects. With its rich geological resources and proactive regulatory approach, Texas is poised to play a significant role in advancing geothermal energy as part of the global energy transition.
