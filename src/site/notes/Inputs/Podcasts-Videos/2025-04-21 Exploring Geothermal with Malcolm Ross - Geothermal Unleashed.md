## Main Points of the Podcast: Exploring the Cutting Edge of Geothermal Energy with Malcolm Ross

**Guest Introduction and Background**

- Malcolm Ross is the Director of Strategic Marketing at Ever Technologies and a geothermal enthusiast with a background in geology and theater.
    
- He previously worked at Shell in upstream exploration and later in new energies, where he was part of the Gamechanger team, focusing on innovative energy solutions.
    
- Ross describes himself as a "black swan detector," seeking out transformative, unexpected innovations in the energy sector.
    

**Inspirational Themes**

- Ross uses the "butterfly effect" and "Back to the Future" metaphors to illustrate how small actions or changes can have significant impacts on the future, encouraging individuals to contribute to decarbonization efforts in any way they can.
    
- He emphasizes the value of nurturing high-risk, high-reward ideas—even if most fail, the rare successes can be transformative.
    

**Shell Gamechanger and Black Swan Detection**

- The Gamechanger team at Shell reviewed hundreds of innovative ideas, with a success rate of less than 4%, but the few successes had outsized impact (e.g., the Prelude floating LNG facility, Greenfire Energy’s closed-loop geothermal technology).
    
- Ross’s role was to identify and support these "black swan" ideas, filtering out impractical concepts and nurturing those with disruptive potential.
    

**Geothermal Technology and Challenges**

- Ross’s entry into geothermal was driven by identifying and addressing the main barriers to adoption within Shell, leading him to focus on closed-loop geothermal systems.
    
- Two major challenges for geothermal energy highlighted:
    
    - **Cost of Drilling and Casing:** This remains the primary obstacle, as drilling deep wells is expensive.
        
    - **Environmental Impacts:** Traditional geothermal can bring pollutants to the surface, but closed-loop systems avoid this by not circulating subsurface fluids to the surface.
        

**Academic Involvement and Education**

- Ross teaches a "Geothermal 101" course at the University of Texas and Rice University, open to students from diverse backgrounds (geology, engineering, policy, environmental sciences).
    
- His teaching aims to inspire students to see geology as a pathway to participate in the green energy transition, not just extractive industries.
    

**Ever Technologies and Project Updates**

- Ever Technologies operates on a licensing model, aiming to have partners implement their closed-loop geothermal technology.
    
- Their flagship project is in Geretsried, near Munich, Germany, where they are retrofitting a failed geothermal site with closed-loop wells.
    
    - The project involves drilling multiple multilaterals (horizontal branches) from vertical wells, resembling the roots of a tree.
        
    - The power plant is already built and will begin generating electricity as soon as the first loop is completed.
        
    - The project will eventually provide both electricity and district heating, depending on the development of local infrastructure.
        

**Geothermal in the US and Policy Challenges**

- Ever is conducting feasibility studies in the US (e.g., University of Colorado, Joint Base San Antonio), but faces challenges due to the US focus on electricity generation rather than direct heat use.
    
- Ross argues that direct-use geothermal (heating/cooling) is underutilized in the US because of limited investment and legislative support.
    
- Another major challenge is the "pipeline of people," as many experienced oil and gas professionals are retiring, and there is a need to train new talent for geothermal expansion.
    

**Policy and Regulatory Issues**

- In Texas, recent legislation assigns ownership of subsurface heat to surface landowners, complicating large-scale geothermal projects in urban areas due to fragmented land ownership.
    
- Ross proposes that in incorporated areas (cities), the city should own the heat, with revenues benefiting all residents, as a potential policy solution.
    

**Conclusion**

- The podcast concludes with a call to action for listeners to contribute to the growth and innovation of geothermal energy, leveraging both individual and collective efforts to drive decarbonization and energy transition
