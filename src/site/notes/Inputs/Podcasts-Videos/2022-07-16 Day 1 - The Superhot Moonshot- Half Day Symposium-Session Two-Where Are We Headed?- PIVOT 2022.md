## Notes

from Perplexity:

This transcript covers a panel discussion on super hot rock geothermal energy at the Pivot 2022 conference. Key points include:

## Definition and Potential

- Super hot rock geothermal involves drilling into rocks above 374Â°C and 20 bars of pressure.
- It has the potential to transform the global energy system by providing scalable, baseload clean energy.

## Challenges and Innovations

- Major challenges include high drilling costs, well completion, and reservoir development.
- Innovations are needed in drilling technology, cementing, and fluid management for high-temperature environments.
- Companies like GA Drilling are developing new drilling methods using plasma to reduce costs and access deeper resources.

## Scalability and Implementation

- Initial projects could focus on depths of 5-7 km before moving to deeper resources.
- Existing geothermal fields could be extended to tap into super hot resources, leveraging existing infrastructure.
- Both open-loop and closed-loop systems are being explored, each with different risk profiles and advantages.

## Key Areas for Development

- Improving drilling efficiency and reducing costs
- Developing high-temperature resistant materials and equipment
- Enhancing reservoir creation and management techniques
- Integrating various technologies for a holistic approach to well construction and operation

The panelists emphasized the importance of demonstration projects to prove the viability of super hot rock geothermal and attract industry interest and investment.
