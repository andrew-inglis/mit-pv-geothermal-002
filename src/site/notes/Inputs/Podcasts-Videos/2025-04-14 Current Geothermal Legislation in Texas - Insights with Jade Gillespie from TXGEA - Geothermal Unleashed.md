## Key Discussion Points: Geothermal Initiatives in Texas

**Introduction & Background**

- Jade Gilletby is the Executive Director of the Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance (Tex GIA), with a background in the Air Force, government, finance, and clean energy advocacy.
    
- Tex GIA is the only trade association in Texas dedicated to representing geothermal energy producers, developers, innovators, and consultants.
    
- Founded in 2023, Tex GIA aims to position Texas as a leader in geothermal energy within the broader energy transition.
    

**2023 Legislative Achievements**

- Consolidated all geothermal permitting and regulatory oversight under the Texas Railroad Commission, streamlining the process for industry growth.
    
- Enabled the adoption and repurposing of orphaned and abandoned wells for geothermal use, fostering innovation.
    
- Clarified statutory rights regarding surface and mineral ownership for geothermal resources, supporting private property rights.
    
- Included geothermal energy as a baseload power resource in Chapter 313 tax abatement programs, providing tax incentives for rural school districts and encouraging geothermal development.
    

**Current Legislative Session: Key Bills & Initiatives**

- Addressing a "cleanup bill" to remove a heavy bond requirement for residential geothermal installers, making it easier for small businesses to operate.
    
- Clarifying the legal definition of a "geothermal conservation well" to distinguish it from battery storage and enable new projects and revenue streams.
    

**Highlighted Bills**

- **HB 3125 (Giraa Bill):** Proposes a geothermal workforce education and training initiative via the Texas Workforce Commission, focusing on partnerships between industry and educational institutions to build a local talent pipeline without relying solely on state funding.
    
- **HB 3240:** Seeks to establish the Texas Geothermal Energy Production Policy Council, creating a formal forum for ongoing collaboration between industry, lawmakers, and regulators to shape strategic energy policy.
    
- **HB 3778:** Aims to define geothermal energy as a "dispatchable" resource, enabling it to compete for funding and recognition alongside nuclear and other baseload power sources, and improving access to capital for developers.
    

**Access to Capital & Texas Energy Fund**

- Ongoing advocacy to allow geothermal projects access to the Texas Energy Fund, either through a specific carveout or by lowering the megawatt threshold for eligibility.
    
- Tex GIA continues to participate in policy discussions to ensure geothermal is included in future funding mechanisms.
    

**Legal & Regulatory Developments**

- Monitoring a Texas Supreme Court case regarding ownership of produced water from oil and gas wells, which could impact the regulatory framework for byproducts like lithium extracted from geothermal brine.
    
- The outcome may influence innovation, investment, and resource recovery strategies in Texas.
    

**Post-Session Focus**

- Tex GIA will be actively involved in the rulemaking process to ensure effective implementation of new laws.
    
- Continued advocacy, member support, and public education to promote geothermal as a reliable, dispatchable, and economically viable energy source for Texas.
    

**Getting Involved**

- Tex GIA welcomes new members from all backgrounds—developers, consultants, students, and industry veterans—to help grow the geothermal sector in Texas.
    
- Multiple membership tiers are available, and the organization is committed to adding value for all participants.
