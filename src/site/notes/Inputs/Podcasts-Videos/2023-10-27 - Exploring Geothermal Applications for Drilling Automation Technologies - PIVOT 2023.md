## Notes

From Perplexity:
## Panel Discussion Summary: [[Drilling Automation\|Drilling Automation]] in Geothermal Energy

## Key Highlights

## Current State of Geothermal

- The US produces the most geothermal power globally, but it represents only 0.4% of electricity grid
- The Biden Administration aims for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035
- Department of Energy seeks to reduce enhanced geothermal production costs by 90%

## Why Drilling Automation is Needed

- Transition from "art" to "science" in geothermal drilling
- Lower drilling costs
- Increase drilling precision
- Improve safety by removing workers from hazardous zones
- Enhance well success rates (currently only 2 out of 3 wells are successful)

## Challenges and Opportunities

- Need for disruptive innovation and new business models
- Require tailored technologies for harsh geothermal conditions
- Potential for workforce transformation, not elimination
- Opportunities to repurpose oil and gas industry expertise and equipment

## Future Outlook

- Collaborative approach between technology providers, startups, and operators
- Focus on incremental improvements and parallel technology development
- Capital investment and scaling remain critical challenges
- Potential for significant job creation in the geothermal sector

## Panelists

- Chris Miller (H&P)
- Tomas Cresco (Neighbors)
- Sylvia (University of Texas at Austin, Bedrock Energy)

The panel emphasized that drilling automation could be a game-changer for geothermal energy development, offering improved efficiency, safety, and economic viability.
