## Notes


key points from the presentation on Canopus Drilling Solutions:

## Company Overview

- Founded in 2019
- Developed patents, hardware, and conducted a pilot test in the past 4 years
- Aims to "wake the sleeping giant" of geothermal energy through directional steel shield drilling technology

## Directional Steel Shield Drilling

- Uses small spherical steel particles (<1mm diameter) injected into drilling mud
- Particles are circulated through the drill string to a special hybrid bit
- Bit combines PDC cutters and steel shot erosion to remove target formation
- Particles pass through a steering shield before reaching the bit

## Injection System

- Housed in a standard 20-foot container
- Contains two pressure vessels for alternating steel shot injection
- Allows continuous injection at about 0.5% concentration by volume
- Much lower concentration needed compared to traditional proppant fracturing

The presentation introduces Canopus Drilling Solutions' novel approach to geothermal drilling, combining conventional drilling techniques with steel particle erosion to potentially improve drilling efficiency and access to geothermal resources.
