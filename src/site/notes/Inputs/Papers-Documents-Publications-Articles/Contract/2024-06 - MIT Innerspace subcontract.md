PHASE 1

ATTACHMENT A  
MIT STATEMENT OF WORK

In the first phase, the focus will be on the Development and Execution Phase. This phase aims to conduct market research/discovery and identify existing technologies at MIT by utilizing an Entrepreneur in Residence (program manager) and MIT students to find tech that has not been applied to geothermal research to understand what is available.

1. Design Phase
    
    - Objective: To establish a new sub-channel for “Geothermal” under the Clean Energy &
        
        Fusion channel of MIT Proto Ventures
        
    - Milestones (July 15, 2024)
        
        - Appointment of Sponsor, Managing Director, Faculty Director
            
        - Securing of funding and resources
            
        - Creation of a new Proto Venture channel
            
    - Hiring of Venture Builder (August 15, 2024)
        
    - Deliverables (July 15, 2024)
        
        - Signed agreement.
            
        - Allocated budget
            
        - Finalized organizational structure for the channel with roles assigned
            
2. Discover Phase (delivered by April 30, 2025)
    
    - Objective: To identify promising opportunity areas for future geothermal (or adjacent) proto
        
        ventures
        
    - Milestones:
        
        - Completion of data collection, technology scouting and research ecosystem engagement (April 30, 2025)
            
        - Hosting of Channel Forum to incorporate expert feedback (by February 1, 2025)
            
    - Deliverables:
        
        - Update report outlining the data collection process as well as a survey of research, tech capabilities, and ecosystem of networks/labs
            
        - Listing of identified opportunities into the Proto Ventures taxonomy made available online for DoE review & approval.
            
        - Shortlist of top 3-5 promising opportunity areas GO / NO GO DECISION POINT FOR PHASE 2
            
            By the end of phase 1, Proto Ventures will have extensively surveyed the MIT innovation ecosystem and identified market needs within the geothermal vertical, made available a database of promising technologies for DOE and GEODE admins (and that will become publicly available later in the timeline), and further prioritized them to define a subset of opportunities (3-5) to look at in the next phase.
            
            Contingent upon a favorable result from Phase 1, the Department of Energy (GTO/DOE) shall determine whether to authorize the continuation of the program under GEODE in Budget Period 2. Should the DOE elect not to approve the continuation, Project InnerSpace shall independently finance Phase 2.
            

PHASE 2

3. Explore Phase (6 months)
    
    - Objective: To select and begin development of team projects that explore identified
        
        opportunities
        
    - Milestones:
        
        - Team formation, with each member exploring 1-2 opportunity areas.
            
        - Development of pitch decks and business materials for selected projects.
            
        - Completion of targeted exploration of technologies and market strategies.
            
    - Deliverables:
        
        - Portfolio of 3-5 team projects, complete with pitch decks and business plans
            
        - Technical, customer and market validation documents for each project
            
4. Build Phase (6 months)
    
    - Objective: De-risk the proto venture technically and in the market, develop a vision for the
        
        first product, and find initial investors
        
    - Milestones:
        
        - Completion of technical de-risking
            
        - Market and customer de-risking (validation of market demand and user feedback)
            
        - Investor de-risking (initiation of fundraising activities and securing initial
            
            investment or grants)
            
        - Development of the vision for the first product offering
            
        - Drafting of business plan and go-to-market strategy
            
    - Deliverables:
        
        - A working prototype, MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or technology roadmap
            
            towards either
            
        - Market validation report, including potential customer and user feedback
            
        - Investment or grant acquisition report, displaying term sheets or explaining pathway
            
            to investment
            
            5. Outcomes
            
    
    - Geothermal startup(s)
        
    - Funded Research into MIT and other R&D exemplars in geothermal
        
    - Growing national geothermal ecosystem
