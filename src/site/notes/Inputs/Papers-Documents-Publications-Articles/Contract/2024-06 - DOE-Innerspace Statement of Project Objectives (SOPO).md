## Questions

Questions to ask on SOPO
- Who wrote the SOPO? Can I talk to them?
	- Who knows?
	- how this all went
	- 2024 aston brought in
	- aston had a startup idea for Jamie
		- GEODE post award
		- Maybe a lot of people
		- Hasn't read the SOPO
		- Dani wrote it - english not first lanuage
		- This is the agreed upon roadmap
	- Gene and Jamie were talking about this 2 years ago.
	- SOW MIT was sitting in the office with Dani David Gene
	- PNP project management
	- GEODE
		- Project
			- Innerspace is an adminisrator
			- Oil gas industry co-administrator
			- Geothermal Rising (?) didn't make the cut
	- No cost extension has been granted
		- still report by April.
	- OK to push the forum channel.
		- Feb 3rd through 7th.
			- last week 
- Hot house
	- Activate area
	- Aston in the VR lounge
- Hot house VR
- 
	- iterating on it
	- launched before climate week
	- 
- How has this changed, ie: what was actually decided on?
	- Is the taxonomy / glossary complete?
		- online and searchable?
		- Internal?
	- What is a SMART Milestone?
	- What is the "GEO model of commercialization"? (page 3)
	- 
	- This is a TON of customer problem discovery in the SOPO.
		- Can I tap into it?
		- Seems that it would have been better to be done before I start exploring at MIT?
	- Task 1.6 involves University Analysis?
		- Is that related to what I am doing at MIT?
		- What section actually defines what I am doing at MIT?
	- Where is the MIT deliverable defined in the SOPO, if at all?
	- What are the Competitive Solicitations Task 6-4 M13-M24?
		- $10M at signing, year 1.
		- the rest of $155M earmarked for pilot projects
		- If I come up with things, 2 year process. all three
			- But there will be different FOAs
			- $25M
			- External FOAs
			- Budget for internal FOAs, R&D initiatives.
		- My opinions will be great.

____________________

Build a technical geothermal taxonomy which reflects legacy as well as current

and emerging geothermal technology.



___________

In Facet 1, the Consortium will conduct a roadmapping exercise to identify and prioritize a set of

validated technologies and methodologies that can have a positive impact in the geothermal

industry, when adapted to the unique conditions and technology requirements for applications.

__________
### What is the "GEO model of commercialization"?

The Consortium will replicate the GEO model of commercialization of applicable “on the bench”

technologies from research institutions, using geothermal startups as a vehicle for delivering

these innovations to market, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as proof of

concept, together with an overall strategy for tech-to-market for the Consortium, which can be

extrapolated to other institutions.
