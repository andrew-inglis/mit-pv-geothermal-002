## Important points:

$20-35/MWhr (Hill et al., 2021) and $46/MWhr (Cladouhos et al., 2018) have been calculated for SHR EGS at flow rates of 80 kg/s. In all three scenarios, the projected costs assume an "nth of a kind” (NOAK) plant after technology de-risking by-doing.

Left unaddressed in these stories are the methods or technologies to extract the heat from SHR resources once it is reached by a drill bit.


reservoir analogs


The Geysers, Salton Sea, Taupo, and Campi Flegrei all include sections of clastic sedimentary reservoir rocks, such as sandstone, greywacke, and shale. In Acoculo, Mexico, and Latera, Italy, reservoir rocks include carbonates (limestone, marble, skarn). Fractured intervals in heterogeneous metamorphic rock (phyllite to gneiss) host plutonic host lithologies have produced superhot temperatures in Iceland, Hawaii, and Japan. Even supercritical fluids in the Larderello geothermal field in Italy. And volcanic, volcaniclastic, and in plutonic-hosted systems, mineralogy ranges from mafic to felsic, which has implications for the thermal conductivity and mechanical behavior of fractured reservoirs at elevated temperatures

reservoir stimulation strategies and reservoir modeling should anticipate a full suite of host rocks; granitic rocks should not be considered the only reservoir targets during exploration or modeling.

the native state of potential SHR EGS sites may be simpler than typical hydrothermal sites

composition of high-temperature fluids encountered in superhot wells has been diverse

The complexity of native fluid chemistry and the impact this has on fluid properties near the critical point is well described in Driesner (2021) and may represent a significant challenge for future SHR reservoir modelers and engineers during operation of natural SHR hydrothermal systems and creation and operation of SHR engineered geothermal systems.

fluids circulated through an engineered geothermal system are likely to be much less corrosive and laden with total dissolved solids than native supercritical fluids

In contrast, EGS fluids will be in contact with reservoir rock for a short time period (months)

analogs observed in magmatic and metamorphic assemblages

the selection of appropriate outcrop analogs is not trivial.

the transition between hydrostatic and lithostatic pressure, possibly related to sealing/rupturing cycles and/or fracture closure due to more ductile behavior, is reported from multiple porphyry ore deposits, and encountered in SHR wells in The Geysers, Salton Sea, Iceland, and Japan (Fournier, 1999). Based on these observations, lower permeability and higher ambient fluid pressure, _and potentially very dynamic changes in pressure_, may need to be considered in SHR EGS development.

suggests that the resulting fracture cloud networks may significantly weaken rocks at the microscale and need different modeling approaches.

As SHR EGS development expands beyond magmatic regions with elevated geothermal gradients, the suite of appropriate reservoir analogs may broaden to include non-magmatic ore deposits, regional metamorphic belts, and even deep sedimentary basins.

geomechanics data currently missing from SHR EGS conceptual models and designs.

properties of fault and fracture networks in low permeability rocks.

The consistently low permeability measured in deep (>3000 m) wells outside of hydrothermal fields illustrates that heat mining cannot rely on preexisting permeability and that to make “geothermal _anywhere_” a reality an engineered system is needed. There are currently two end-member approaches to this engineering challenge: closed-loop geothermal systems (CLGS), which do not attempt to change the permeability of the formation, and engineered geothermal systems (EGS), which do.

increase flow rate, increase flow temperature, or both. The perforate stimulations max out near 200 °C, which is the upper limit of the gas generation window.

The goal of SHR Engineered Geothermal produced fluids through accessing increased temperature and flow. Oil-and-gas-inspired hydraulic Systems is to develop the technologies and methods to drastically increase the enthalpy of fracturing completions may ultimately be extended to superhot rock, but not by using currently available off-the-shelf equipment.

The importance of natural fractures and complexity at SHR conditions is clearly unknown and is discussed below as a knowledge gap.

The performance target for EGS models of this type is often stated as <10% temperature decline in 20-30 years (Kennedy et al., 2021), but this may be overly conservative for optimal ROI (McClure, 2021). A key finding of Kennedy et al. (2021) is that to meet performance targets (5 MW over a 20-year lifetime with a 150 °C initial ∆T) about 4 million m2 of surface area are needed for reasonable rock and fluid thermal properties. As an example, to achieve that amount of surface area would require 200 fractures along a 2 km long lateral (assuming a 10 m fracture spacing), 200 m well spacing, and 100 m high fractures. Of course, there are many other geometries and fracture models to achieve the 4 million m2 of surface area required for a sustainable system including the other three conceptual models shown in Figure 4.

Therefore, the geomechanics knowledge base and modeling tools utilized in oil and gas stimulations will have limited applicability until shown otherwise.

ResFrac has been used at EGS projects such as FORGE (McClure, 2023a) and Fervo’s Project Red (Norbeck et al., 2023; Norbeck and Latimer, 2023). Recent modeling by McClure (2023b) shows the strength of an integrated hydraulic fracture and reservoir simulation model at a modeled temperature of 246 °C. The results of this physics-based model suggest that thermoelastic fracture opening and downward propagation during long-term circulation can improve the thermal longevity of an engineered geothermal system by providing access to new hotter rock. This is also a capability that full THMC models such as TReactMech can perform (Sonnenthal et al., 2018), thus a code comparison and extension to SHR fracturing could be used to check these intriguing results.


Thus, without field results, a predictive model will still likely miss the mark. One key gap is a lack of knowledge of the geomechanical parameters for different rock types at elevated temperatures and pressures, which are needed for this modeling work.

the directional drilling part of the shale revolution is leveraged, but not hydraulic stimulation.

Toews and Holmes (2021) model that a closed-loop geothermal system with 72 km of multi-laterals drilled into rock with an average temperature of 350 °C and flow rate of 96 kg/s will initially (for less than a month) generate over 18 MWe and then an average of 8 MWe for 30 years.

seems to be targeting formation temperatures less than 300 °C (XGS Energy, 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Second, because flow rates will be relatively high in a closed-loop geothermal system compared to the rate of conductive heat flow, the rocks adjacent to the well will cool rapidly

integrated model (i.e., Figure 4 of Driesner (2021)) for brittle deformation in superhot reservoirs with the influence of natural fractures does not yet exist.

critical issue for THMC models of SHR EGS operations is the role of mineral dissolution and precipitation on fracture transmissibility.

There is a lack of thermodynamic and kinetic data needed for modeling fluid-rock interaction within the P-T conditions of the supercritical regime.

These experiments showed cloud or distributed brittle deformation

The durability of well construction materials at SHR conditions has been a concern since on-site testing at IDDP-1 was found to contain highly corrosive HCl and HF

A key component of state-of-the-art laboratory testing is monitoring of acoustic emissions (AE). For example, Ko et al. (2023) used AE to determine packing strength and crush resistance of proppants at temperatures of 320 °C. Goto et al. (2021b) used AE to measure the onset of rock failure difficult to observe by other means.


Gaps

Several types of test apparatus will be needed for measurement of properties of rock, cement, and other downhole materials at SHR conditions (375-600 °C) as outlined by Petty et al. (2023):

- A comprehensive, worldwide survey is needed of the capabilities of existing laboratories and upgrade pathways to reach SHR conditions.
- Lab measurements of fracture toughness and the effects of thermal shock on rock weakening.
- Robust measurement of the geomechanical properties of various rock types at high temperatures and pressures.
- Porosity, density, and permeability of various rock types as a function of temperature and pressure.
- Thermal properties – thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, thermal expansion and heat capacity – of various rock types at high temperatures and pressures.
- Fluid/rock interactions – dissolution and precipitation in rocks and cements.
- Material properties - solubility, stability, strength, and thermal properties for materials such as cements, proppants, diverters, drilling fluids, tracers and additives such as corrosion and scale inhibitors, treatment chemicals, friction reducers, foaming agents, and others.
- Mechanical properties of casing materials and casing components at very high temperatures and under stresses produced with thermal cycling.
- Downhole instrumentation and tools such as logging instruments and cables as well as methods for conveying and deploying downhole tools and instruments.
- Further laboratory study of the behavior of rock near the BDT. For instance, will the cloud fracturing reported by Goto et al. (2021b) have an impact on rock strength and fracture propagation in the field? What laboratory scale (if any) tests can be done to investigate?
- Quantification of the impact of phase transition (esp. through critical point) on flow properties of EGS fluids.



2D and 3D active seismic survey data highlighted a deep seismic marker named the “K-horizon” that was hypothesized to be supercritical fluids based on the offset well San Pompeo 2 (Baccarin et al., 2019). However, this seismic marker was not found to be supercritical fluids when intersected by the deepened Vendelle-2 well.


Gaps

- Geophysical surveys and seismic monitoring continue to need validation through drilling.
- Reliable, drilling-validated geophysical signatures of SHR targets will reduce risk of SHR development and well targeting.

Drilling a vertical or near vertical well into rock above 500 °C has been accomplished with PDC or roller cone bits (Kruszewski and Wittig, 2018) without monitoring while drilling (MWD) or rotary steerable systems (RSS).


The last two drill bits were Stingblades, PDCs with conical diamond elements, that drilled at 4.0 and 9.2 m/hr and lasted 101 and 179 m

have often been related to thermal cycling and cold-water quenching.

Well completions that can withstand thermal cycling, either planned or unplanned, will be critical for constructing SHR wells that will last.

SHR EGS wells are not expected to encounter significant volumes of harsh native fluids

The project deployed a 300 °C directional drilling system developed by Baker Hughes using DOE funds (Dick et al., 2012) that employed helium down-hole refrigeration... Unfortunately, this particular M2M technology has not been further developed or used.


Instead, the reason for directional drilling of the first well will be to maximize lateral reach of a well in order to intersect or create more vertical fractures.

Another recent demonstration is the use of Insulated Drill Pipe (IDP) at the Eavor-Deep well in New Mexico (Brown et al., 2023). IDP and mud coolers can be used to cool the well bore of a 350 °C well to 150 °C, allowing for the use of ordinary (elastomer dependent) MWD and mud been tested in SHR (Eavor, 2023b). IDP will be even more effective when paired with continuous motors. The Eavor-Deep well only reached 250 °C formation, so IDPs full advantage has not yet circulation and cooling systems at the surface as downhole temperatures spike quickly when circulation is broken for any reason.

- Directional drilling in SHR has been demonstrated just a few times and is likely to be expensive and time-consuming. Serious investment and learn-by-doing will be needed to further reduce risks, costs, and drilling time.
- Due to the great risk to drillers and project success, measures to contain extreme pressures must be developed and implemented.
- Well completions that can withstand extreme thermal cycling from SHR production to cold-water quenching will need to be designed and tested.

- Tools and methods to gather fracture and stress data (XLOT, image logs, etc.) must be extended to superhot conditions (i.e., 450 °C).
- The potential for variability of stress orientations at depth has not been evaluated due to limited stress measurement data at depth.

1. Wellbore completion, which can be subdivided into
	1. Zonal isolation on the outside of casing, and
	2. Zonal isolation on the inside of the casing.
2. Hydraulic stimulation, which can be subdivided into
	1. Fracture initiation,
	2. Fracture growth, and optionally
	3. Proppant emplacement

- Testing of a complete system as described above requires either field testing in SHR wells or an extremely large sample (i.e., >1 m blocks), superheated rock mechanics laboratory. Individual, specific components and solutions discussed below, can also be tested separately.



A good cement job in conventional geothermal wells is notoriously difficult (Finger and Blankenship, 2012). A bad cement job will not provide zonal isolation, making the risk of a useless well high.


The most cost-effective approach to well isolation may be to develop methods that do not require steel and cement. Open hole stimulations have been performed up to 320 °C (Cladouhos et al., 2015; Cladouhos et al., 2016), although a perforated liner (uncemented) was eventually needed. Other approaches to eliminating liner installation include mineral coating, such as RockPipe (Eavor, 2023a) or vitrification (Houde et al., 2021), installed after or during drilling.

Gaps

- Development and testing of cements and steel designed to withstand SHR conditions.
- Advanced cements need to be used and evaluated in SHR wells.
- Tested alternative methods to provide zonal isolation behind casing such as mineral coating, or advanced materials to fill annular space.
- Further development and testing of external casing packers for T >400 °C

Other approaches to fracture initiation and growth include thermal shocking, acids (Lucas et al., 2020), chelating agents (Watanabe et al., 2021b), and targeting natural fractures.

Gaps
- Due to the importance of scale, it will be difficult to test any fracture initiation methods anywhere but in SHR wells and SHR EGS demonstration projects.


- No one has performed hydraulic stimulations at high or moderate pressures in SHR, thus the geomechanics of rocks near the BDT, thermal cracking, and the effect of the unusual properties of supercritical fluids have not been field tested.
- Maximum fracture length induced by stimulations in SHR EGS represents a critical knowledge gap due to the impact of supercritical fluid, BDT, thermal fracturing, and intragranular fracturing. Results from models and lab testing (see above) may provide useful predictions; however, until field tests in actual SHR wells are performed and documented potential fracture size in SHR EGS reservoirs will remain one of the most important unknowns.


The water need not be potable and can be re-used for circulation once the EGS reservoir is created.

 acids, friction reducers, and scale inhibitors will likely be needed. Given the extreme temperatures and depths, the additives will likely not be the same as those in current use.


additives pumped into the subsurface during drilling, stimulation, or long-term injection are disclosed and reviewed by both federal and state regulators. In some cases, heavy salts such as NaBr and NaCl might be useful to increase the density of the water column and thus the downhole fluid pressure.

Hot wet CO2 would be very corrosive and could help to dissolve and etch the rock to preserve open fractures without proppants (Petty et al., 2020). However, care would need to be taken as hot wet CO2 would also be detrimental to any steel casing.


An alternative to the use of proppants would be to operate at fluid pressures high enough that fractures are hydro-propped, that is the operating injection pressure would be significantly greater than the magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress. The economics of hydro-propping at resource temperatures from 175-350 °C were modeled by Frash et al. (2023a; 2023b). Technically, operating at high pressures is feasible, for example, the Habanero well pair in the Cooper Basin, Australia produced 19 kg/s of 215 °C water with a production wellhead pressure of 32 MPa and an injection well pressure of 43 MPa (Hogarth and Bour, 2015).

initial fracture transmissivity (often called fracture permeability, which is not technically accurate) and its evolutions with time and flow.

SHR-durable tracers will need to be developed.

- Research and development of non-toxic additives to prevent scale, reduce friction, and enhance flow rates at SHR conditions.
- Proppant placement and chemical, thermal, and mechanical durability at SHR conditions.
- A wide range of proppants and fluids should be tested in flow-through reactors developed for SHR testing (also see section 3.2).
- If proppants cannot be developed to withstand the heat, are there other methods (high- density fluid, hydropropping, chemical treatments, or others) to maintain create and maintain permeability?
- Will fracture permeability increase or decrease with time? Factors causing a decrease will include fracture closure, proppant dissolution, and precipitation. Factors causing an increase will include thermal cooling, host rock dissolution, and fluid channeling.
- What tracers can be used at SHR conditions?


Possibly the most important lesson is that EGS projects in urban areas like Pohang and Basel should be avoided until a method to identify blind, critically stressed faults in advance of well stimulations is developed.

It has been suggested that reservoir creation near the brittle-ductile transition will reduce seismic risk (i.e., Japan Beyond Brittle, Muraoka et al., 2014). However, seismologic observations and numerical models suggest many earthquakes nucleate at depths of 7-10 km in rocks near the BDT (i.e., Chen and Molnar ,1983; Lapusta and Rice, 2003) and others argue that SHR EGS may be prone to enhanced seismicity (Parisio et al., 2019a), so this idea needs further testing.

Fortunately, areas with high temperature gradients (>100 °C/km) where the first SHR projects will be tested, correlate with areas of low seismic risk due to thinner brittle crust and high heat flow. It is documented that the Ridgecrest earthquake swarms of 2020 were suppressed in the Coso geothermal area (Kaven, 2020).

Gaps
- Better understanding of the geomechanics in the brittle-ductile transition/ K Horizon.
- Given that the zone does not transmit S waves as readily will it have an impact on reducing seismic risk?
- Investigating whether induced seismicity due to cold fluid injection migrates downward as modeled by (McClure, 2023b). Can seismic data from geothermal injection programs (i.e., Hartline, Walters and Wright (2019)) be used to test the hypothesis?

The standard lifespan assumed for geothermal wells is often 20-30 years, consistent with the lifespan of the power purchase agreement (PPA) and power plant (Kennedy et al., 2021; Toews and Holmes, 2021).


While make-up wells can be built into resource plans, geothermal power plants often operate under capacity due to lack of pro-active planning and ready-capital or lack of extra resource.

An alternative strategy for the lifespan of geothermal wells is 10-15 years (i.e., McClure, 2021).

By drilling fewer wells up-front, and operating at thermally “non-sustainable” flow rates, capital costs for drilling can be spread out over the lifetime of the project. One could even imagine a strategy more akin to O&G field development where a well is always being drilled on the site.

This would also provide more opportunities for learning-by-doing both for drilling and stimulation (Latimer and Meier, 2017), and reduce mobilization and far-from-drilling support center costs which can currently represent 10-30% of the costs at remote locations.

In the past, geothermal power production has been considered baseload generation. With few exceptions, PPAs have provided flat pricing, thus there has been no incentive for producers to produce more or less than the PPA when asked by the offtaker or utility. If properly designed and paid for, geothermal power plants can provide flexible electricity generation. This is especially true of SHR geothermal power plants because the steam produced can be flexibly throttled or boosted to meet demand. For example, stored heat from solar energy can be used to superheat steam to generate more power at times of high demand and high price (Rosenfeld and Petty, 2023), or surplus electricity can be used to build up subsurface pressure for later use (Ricks, Norbeck and Jenkins, 2021, 2022). In either case, the off-taker and geothermal developer need to work together during project development to maximize project flexibility and provide the right incentives.

- Industry demonstration and commercial scale-up roadmaps.
- In addition to low LCOE, investigations of other advantages can SHR EGS provide. For example, baseload/firm power, energy security via local energy resources; power for growth and new industries in developing countries; hydrogen transportation fuels.
- What creative financing and PPA ideas can make all geothermal even more economically attractive?

geophysical and well engineering methods for measuring properties and changes in the earth’s crust and geothermal reservoirs.

Downhole geophone arrays often used in O&G hydraulic fracturing jobs, have had limited success in geothermal fields due to the relatively low temperature tolerance of geophones and high shallow temperatures in geothermal fields. At FORGE Utah, a distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber optic (FO) array installed in a 985 m deep monitoring well outperformed borehole geophones for locating microseismic events (Lellouch et al., 2020). An even more effective approach is to install DAS-FO sensing arrays in multiple wells (injectors, producers, and monitoring wells) at reservoir depth (Norbeck and Latimer, 2023). An extra benefit of installation of fiber optics in reservoir or near-reservoir depths is the ability to also perform distributed strain sensing (DSS) (Norbeck and Latimer, 2023; Ward-Baranyay et al., 2023). While distributed acoustic sensing fiber optic arrays have only been used up to 200 °C, AFL has recently developed a 500 °C gold-coated FO cable (AFL, 2023) which could be used in SHR wells in the near future. Other geophysical methods that may be useful for EGS characterization are INSAR (Mellors et al., 2018), gravity modeling (Bonneville et al., 2017), and magnetotellurics (Pauling et al., 2023). 

Finally, well testing will be crucial to the characterization of any EGS, including pressure monitoring, pressure transient analysis, circulation testing, tracer testing, etc. (Horne, 1995).

Part of the solution to solving the challenges of producing SHR is one of system integration. Many of the pieces may be out there, but scientists, engineers, and service providers around the world may not yet know that they hold knowledge and technology that can transform geothermal energy. Two obvious examples where outreach and education could provide new insights for SHR geothermal are earth scientists and engineers in the O&G industry and academic institutions.


In academic institutions, examples of experts that have not yet engaged in and have little knowledge of SHR resources include economic geologists, volcanologists, seismologists, and structural geologists. As the section on reservoir analogs shows, geologists and geophysicists have been studying rocks on both sides of the BDT for many years and can bring many insights to the challenges likely to be encountered in SHR development. In the US, more collaboration between researchers normally funded by NSF (National Science Foundation) and those normally by DOE would yield benefits. One of the most effective approaches to system integration is public investment in demonstration projects. In countries with strong geothermal industries and government support (Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, and Japan), there is ongoing support for superhot geothermal both at the system integration and targeted funding levels.


“as exemplars, proving reliability and performance ultimately de-risking the

technologies,”

• “as experiments from which to learn, because upscaling typically identifies new problems

that are not apparent at smaller scales and allows the community to settle on a ‘dominant’

design,” and

• “as opportunities for collaboration, such that best practices can be established, and

processes can be standardized and improved.”

In planning and executing demonstrations projects, gaps not anticipated during the proposal

writing phase will be revealed. It is important that funding agencies recognize that to maximize

successes and learnings from demonstration projects, additional secondary funding for data

analysis, tools development, and new collaboration will be necessary. For example, a gap

discovered during a demonstration project on one continent might be best solved by a collaborator

on a different continent.

Public investment will be essential to bring SHR geothermal projects to fruition in a timeframe

that could be useful to address issues such as greenhouse gas mitigation and energy security.

Bridging the gaps identified in this paper will require significant financial commitments globally

to support investigations at academic institutions, national laboratories, and public-private

partnerships. Such investment will result in reducing risk for further investment of venture capital.

Moreover, early projects will need to occur where the heat is relatively shallow. This will

inherently be a global endeavor. Projects in Iceland, Italy and elsewhere funded under the

European Union’s Horizon 2020 program provided foundational groundwork in the drilling of

supercritical geothermal systems and spurred several drilling projects that resulted in significant

learnings and technologies in turn. The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) has drilled two

superhot wells, IDDP-1 and IDDP-2, and is planning a third. The learnings from this two-decade

long project on drilling, well completion, corrosion, etc. have been immense and the extensive

published literature will be invaluable for future SHR projects worldwide. The DEEPEN project

is an EU-funded project with a global team with the goal to develop a methodology to explore and

characterize superhot and supercritical geothermal plays (Kolker et al., 2022). International

collaborations like these should be encouraged and continued. For example, an annual

international workshop with a narrow focus on SHR geothermal with a broad invite list to include

scientists and engineers with expertise across the gaps would serve to facilitate the interdisciplinary

and international collaboration needed to develop solutions and fill gaps. Ideally, these workshops

would be hosted at potential SHR sites (i.e., in Japan, Iceland, Italy, New Zealand, Oregon,

California).





**5.** **Conclusion**

High enthalpy superhot rock EGS presents a promising path to scale clean, firm, cost-competitive

geothermal electricity production worldwide, but significant scientific and development

uncertainty surrounds these resources. In this paper, we discussed the technologies needed to create

SHR reservoirs and describe critical gaps ripe for public and private funding necessary to break

down potential roadblocks.

A key conclusion is that solving the challenges of creating and producing SHR geothermal

reservoirs will require international and multidisciplinary collaboration, system integration, and

demonstration projects. The scope of the challenge invites partnership, not just between

geothermal and oil and gas operators, but also with those that offer broader expertise in deep,

higher temperature systems, such as economic geologists and metamorphic petrologists, and

engineers and labs that routinely work beyond the critical point of water.

Although superhot rock geothermal will push the limits of many subsurface tools and is beyond

the bounds of current hydrothermal and EGS projects, it should be noted that humans safely and

routinely operate equipment that contains materials above 375 °C. Coal power plants burn at

550 °C, nuclear power plants at 700 °C, and pizza ovens at 400 °C. That is, we can engineer

equipment to access, contain, and extract energy from the global SHR resource - engineers and

scientists need the incentive to do so.
