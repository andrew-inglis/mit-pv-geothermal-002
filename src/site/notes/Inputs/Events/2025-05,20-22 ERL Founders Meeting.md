# Annual Founding Members Meeting 2025

---

# **Solid Earth Science for the Energy Transition**

![](https://erlweb.mit.edu/files/2025/05/AFMM25-Poster-18-24-225x300.png)

For over thirty years, the Earth Resources Laboratory has been MIT’s home for earth science and engineering relevant to the energy industry. Each spring, we invite representatives of our Founding Member companies to MIT to hear about our latest research. This year, we are excited to open up the meeting to new potential collaborators in industry and at MIT as we develop innovative strategies for sustainably and responsibly addressing modern societal needs, such as carbon-free energy production, access to critical minerals, freshwater resources, and the safe, permanent storage of atmospheric CO₂. 

In addition to presentations by MIT researchers, this year’s meeting will include brief talks by collaborators and prospective collaborators in industry and the non-profit space. Out keynote speaker will be Bradford Hager, the Cecil and Ida B. Green Professor of Earth Science and former director of ERL, who will share exciting new development in geologic hydrogen research at MIT.

**If you would like to attend, please contact erl-info@mit.edu for the registration link.**
