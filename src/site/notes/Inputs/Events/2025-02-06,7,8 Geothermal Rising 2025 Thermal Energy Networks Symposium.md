## terminology talk 2:30

### Briant Jones

dei -> workforce success
decarbinization -> localization and lowering costs
green -> all american energy

doesn't have a tech problem, has a communication problem

statutory barriers

- #thinkthermal
- It's like a family with geothermal is the last name
	- pick the tech
	- pick the temperature
- A lot of terms
	- built on the legislative history


## how to make a Framingham (oil and gas to geothermal)

(came in at the questions)
- pipe fitters said that there are regulations for these pipes, and they are ready
- lots of capex, how about opex?
	- Answer: will find out in Framingham.


# Break
talked to [[Evergreen/People/Jay Egg\|Jay Egg]]
	- will reach out and have a zoom with him in a couple of weeks

better rigs for fast precise geo-fields any subsurface
residential to networked (100s of wells)

[[Evergreen/Companies/RH White Construction\|RH White Construction]]
fixed price for RFP, challenges, risks, costs going 15% 45% higher. issue, working on it.
talking about risk share.
Taking planning to another level
reverse bids are not OK.


Celcius



Buro Happold
- looked at Massachusetts GeoMicroDistricts
- feasibility studies



Cary Smith
- Drill first
